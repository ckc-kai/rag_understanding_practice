    "response": "The \"Build Trap\" is defined as an organizational practice where companies prioritize measuring success through the quantity of features shipped rather than the actual value these features provide to customers. This focus leads to a decline in user satisfaction and market share, often due to an inability to solve customer problems or innovate effectively. Companies can break free from this trap by adopting more robust product management practices that prioritize outcomes over outputs.",

      "The Build T rap\nThe build trap is when organizations become stuck measuring their suc-\ncess by outputs rather than outcomes. It\u2019s when they focus more on ship-\nping and developing features rather than on the actual value those things\nproduce. When companies stop producing real value for the users, they\nbegin to lose market share, allowing them to be disrupted. Companies can\nget out of the build trap by setting themselves up to develop intentional\nand robust product management practices.",
      "the build trap by company policy, even when they know it\u2019s the wrong way to\nbuild things.\nTying livelihoods to the fact that you shipped product at all, instead of learn-\ning or solving problems for customers, is what gets people into the build trap. It\nalso means that people are afraid to try anything new. This mentality stifles inno-\nvation.",

Based on the provided context:\n\n1. **The Waiter**: This archetype is described as a product manager who acts as an order taker, focusing solely on gathering stakeholders' wants without considering strategic direction or vision. They are reactive and lack deep strategic thinking.\n\n2. **The Idealist**: This archetype might refer to someone overly focused on achieving a single vision without compromise, potentially neglecting broader goals or stakeholder needs beyond their immediate vision.\n\n3. **The Problem-Solver**: This could describe a product manager who prioritizes solving specific problems without considering the overall business strategy or alignment with customer needs, focusing narrowly on details rather than strategic direction.\n\nThese archetypes are inferred from the context provided, highlighting the limitations of bad product managers in strategic thinking and collaboration.",

There is no vision.\nThere is no decision making involved.",

Push-\ning back is essential to building a successful product. That\u2019s part of the job.\nIt\u2019s very possible to find the waiter archetype paired with another one, like\nproject management.",

Teachers were spending upward of 80 hours over two months editing videos, or reshooting them to avoid editing, because they were marketing experts, not video experts.

    "response": "The Strategic Gaps identified by Stephen Bungay refer to internal friction within organizations due to mismatches between desired outcomes and actual actions. These gaps are categorized into three main types:\n\n1. **Knowledge Gap**: This gap exists between management's desired knowledge and what is actually known within the organization. To bridge this, organizations often provide detailed information or data sharing. However, correct practice involves allowing employees to access necessary information without micromanagement, fostering a better understanding of their roles.\n\n2. **Alignment Gap**: This gap arises when there is a mismatch between what employees are doing and what management expects them to do. Incorrect filling involves providing detailed instructions that lead to compliance without strategy or initiative. The correct approach is to let each level within the company define its own methods as per higher-level intentions, promoting autonomy and alignment.\n\n3. **Effects Gap**: Although not explicitly detailed in the provided context, this gap likely refers to the disconnect between desired outcomes and planned actions. It might involve issues where plans do not translate effectively into results due to lack of monitoring or communication across departments.\n\nIn summary, while organizations aim to bridge these gaps through various mechanisms, understanding their correct implementation is crucial for effective strategic alignment and goal achievement.",
