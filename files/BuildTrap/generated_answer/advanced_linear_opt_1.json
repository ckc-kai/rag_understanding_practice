    "question": "According to the text, what is the definition of the 'Build Trap'?",
    "response": "The \"Build Trap\" refers to an organizational pitfall where companies prioritize producing features over delivering real value to customers. Rooted in metrics focusing on output rather than outcomes, it leads organizations into a cycle of feature shipping without solving customer problems, ultimately causing market disruption and losing competitiveness by neglecting the core purpose of creating valuable products.",

      "The Build T rap\nThe build trap is when organizations become stuck measuring their suc-\ncess by outputs rather than outcomes. It\u2019s when they focus more on ship-\nping and developing features rather than on the actual value those things\nproduce. When companies stop producing real value for the users, they\nbegin to lose market share, allowing them to be disrupted. Companies can\nget out of the build trap by setting themselves up to develop intentional\nand robust product management practices. At that point, product manag-\ners can find the opportunities to maximize business and customer value.\n1\nPART | I",
      "the build trap by company policy, even when they know it\u2019s the wrong way to\nbuild things.\nTying livelihoods to the fact that you shipped product at all, instead of learn-\ning or solving problems for customers, is what gets people into the build trap. It\nalso means that people are afraid to try anything new. This mentality stifles inno-\nvation. Even though many people are seeking training and would like to work\nwith good product management principles, they are afraid that doing so will pre-\nvent them from making money. If we are holding people accountable to new\nways of working in these large company transformations, why are we judging\ntheir success with outdated methods?\nAlthough it\u2019s easy to think that much of this is out of a product manager\u2019s\ncontrol, given that the C-Suite and leaders of an organization usually set the rules\nfor incentives, that might not be the complete truth. My advice for people is to\npush back. I know it\u2019s scary, but it can also be effective. I once had a product\nmanager attend one of my workshops at a conference. At the end, she came up\nand told me that she thinks she is building the wrong thing: \u201cI want to talk to my\nboss about it, but I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m basically putting myself out of a job because I\u2019m\nsaying the product I own is not the right product to build. My entire bonus is tied\nto launching this thing.\u201d\nWe talked through an action plan for her organizational policies, and she\nwent back and presented her case to her boss. She explained that she had ana-\nlyzed the strategy for the division, and she had preliminary data that suggested\nthat the product they were building was not a good idea. Her boss listened, and\nhe agreed with her. They worked out how to sunset the product over two months.\nHe ended up moving her to a more important product and gave her more senior-\nity on the team\u2014a win-win situation.\nEven though it\u2019s difficult to change many of the policies, if you don\u2019t have the\nseniority, you can still try to change the minds of the people who can bring those\nmessages up the chain. This can start the right dialogue. Talk to your bosses\nabout what success really means.",

Then he made sure to follow up with them, ask their\nopinions, and give credit back to the team. He still had to win their trust back,\nbut he was definitely going in the right direction.\nListening to everyone\u2019s opinions is important, but it doesn\u2019t mean a product\nmanager should implement every suggestion. Swinging too far in that direction\nbrings us to the other most common archetype of the product manager: the\nwaiter.\nThe Waiter\nThe waiter is a product manager who, at heart, is an order taker. They go to their\nstakeholders, customers, or managers, ask for what they want, and turn those\nwants into a list of items to be developed. There is no goal. There is no vision.\nThere is no decision making involved. This was the archetype of 90% of the\nproduct owner teams at Marquetly.\nThe most common question I get from product managers in this position is,\n\u201cHow do I prioritize?\u201d Because they have no goal in which to provide context for\ntrade-offs, it becomes a popularity contest for whomever is making the request.\nMore often than not, the most important person gets their features prioritized.\nThis happens frequently in very large companies. The product managers go out,\nwith all the right intentions, to talk to their customers and learn what they want.\nBut, instead of discovering problems, waiters ask, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d The cus-\ntomer asks for a specific solution, and these product managers implement them.\nThis is where you end up in what my friend David Bland, product advisor and\nconsultant, calls the product death cycle, shown in Figure 6-1.\n28 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP",
      "Figure 6-1. The product death cycle, by David J. Bland (reprinted by permission of David J.\nBland)\nThe product death cycle is a specific form of the build trap. You are imple-\nmenting ideas without validating them. It\u2019s not the customer\u2019s job to come up\nwith their own solutions. That is your job. You need to deeply understand their\nproblems and then determine the best solutions for them.\nWaiters are reactive thinkers, not strategic thinkers. There\u2019s usually an\namount of learned helplessness that contributes to that. They don\u2019t believe that\nthey can push back on these solutions and dive deeper into problems. But that\u2019s\nnot true. Customers want their problems solved. Leaders want to hit goals. Push-\ning back is essential to building a successful product. That\u2019s part of the job.\nIt\u2019s very possible to find the waiter archetype paired with another one, like\nproject management. Because they are not focused on the why, they tend to focus\na lot on the when. Project managers who are put into product management roles\noften become waiters waving a calendar.\nThe Former Project Manager\nProduct managers are not project managers, although a little project manage-\nment is needed to execute on the role correctly. Project managers are responsible\nfor the when. When will a project finish? Is everyone on track? Will we hit our\ndeadline?\nProduct managers are responsible for the why?

      "Bad Product Manager\nArchetypes\nThere are few paths available today to learn product management. It isn\u2019t taught\nat college. Training programs on the job are usually lacking. Microsoft and Goo-\ngle are two of the only major companies that actually have an entry-level career\npath for product managers. Internships are few and far between. And most prod-\nuct managers you meet have made either a lateral move inside their company or\nhave been \u201cpromoted\u201d from software development.\nIf you are lucky enough to be taught product management, what you learn is\nusually very tactile: writing requirements documents (or user stories in Agile),\nplanning meetings with developers, running check-in meetings, gathering\nrequests from the business team, and testing for acceptance of the developed\nwork and bugs. Many of these steps stem from the work of product managers\nwho operate in a traditional Waterfall environment. This is the environment in\nwhich I learned.\nUnder a Waterfall process, the first step for a product manager is to talk to\nthe people in the business\u2014usually called internal stakeholders\u2014and ask them for\ntheir input and requests. This is encouraged in the trainings of newly minted\nproduct managers: always satisfy your stakeholder. In my first role, I was told\nthat the stakeholders were the marketing managers, my boss, and the sales\nteams. I met with them weekly, gained an understanding of what they needed\naccomplished, and then turned those requirements into specs.\nAfter the requirements are detailed out, they are usually handed to the\ndesigners to create an attractive-looking interface, while working with the devel-\nopers to ensure that the systems requirements are there. After the product man-\nagers approve the designers\u2019 work, the software engineers can begin coding.\n25\n| 6",

Instead, they need to rely on influencing them to actually move in\na certain direction.\nOut of this wonderful CEO myth emerged an archetype of a very arrogant\nproduct manager who thinks they rule the world. I found one of these types at\nMarquetly. His name was Nick. Nick had just graduated from business school\nand was hired into the company as a product manager. All of the developers\nhated him. The UX designers, too. Why?\nFrankly, Nick was terrible to the designers and developers. He specifically\nwanted to be a product manager because he fancied himself the next Steve Jobs,\na visionary who would dictate, from on high, to his team everything they should\nbuild. Needless to say, the rest of his team didn\u2019t like that very much. He was\nfrustrated. \u201cThe team won\u2019t listen to me. I can\u2019t get them to build what I want.\u201d\nPoor Nick.

After all, I was the visionary.\nThis was my JOB. If anyone came to me with another idea, I dismissed it imme-\ndiately. That attitude does not win you friends. And, honestly, I was miserable.\nMy team didn\u2019t want to work with me.\u201d\nI had his attention. I kept going. \u201cSo, one day, my boss took me aside and\ntold me that if I didn\u2019t start winning over the team, I was going to fail. That\u2019s\nwhen I changed my approach.

But, at the end of the day, it\u2019s the team, collectively, that really\nowns the product\u2014the what.\nFiguring out what to build takes a strategic and experimental approach. The\nproduct manager should be at the helm of these experiments, while continuing\nto identify and reveal every known unknown. At the beginning of product devel-\nopment, the known unknowns are usually around problem exploration and cus-\ntomer behavior, such as, \u201cWe\u2019re not sure what problem we are solving for the\ncustomer.\u201d As these unknowns begin to become clearer, the uncertainty then\nshifts to what will solve that customer problem.\nProduct managers connect the dots. They take input from customer\nresearch, expert information, market research, business direction, experiment\nresults, and data analysis. Then they sift through and analyze that information,\nusing it to create a product vision that will help to further the company and to\nsolve the customers\u2019 needs.\nTo do that, a product manager must be humble enough in their approach to\nlearn and take into account that they don\u2019t know all of the answers. They need to\nknow that there are assumptions that they must tackle along the way, approach-\ning them with a scientific mindset to validate them and to reduce risk. Ulti-\nmately, the goal for the product manager is that\u2014reducing risk by focusing on\nlearning. Most important, they need to know that not all good ideas are their\nown.\nT ech Expert Versus Market Expert\nA great product manager needs to be able to interface with the business, technol-\nogy, and design departments and to harness their collective knowledge. One of\nthe worst traits a product manager can have is the lone wolf mentality\u2014the idea\nthat they are the only one responsible for the success of their product. This\ncauses them to become arrogant and dismissive of their teams\u2019 ideas. Great prod-\nuct managers understand that they will get further by taking advantage of the\nskills and expertise of their team.\nProduct managers do not come up with solutions in vacuums. They work\nwith the UX designer to understand key workflows for the user, and experience\nfactors could help reach the users\u2019 goals. They work with developers to determine\nhow to launch a product or features quickly to the market.",

      "outcomes. When leaders do not see progress toward goals, they quickly resort to\ntheir old ways.\nWe need a cadence of communicating strategy that matches our strategic\nframework. Remember our four levels of strategy: vision, strategic intent, prod-\nuct initiatives, and options. Each of these is on a different time horizon, and pro-\ngress toward them should be communicated accordingly.\nMost companies I\u2019ve worked with have a few core meetings to evaluate pro-\ngress and to make strategic decisions from a product level:\n\u2022 Quarterly business reviews\n\u2022 Product initiative reviews\n\u2022 Release reviews\nDuring quarterly business review  meetings, the senior leadership team, made\nup of the executives and the highest level of the organization, should be discus-\nsing progress toward the strategic intents and outcomes of a financial nature.\nThis includes reviewing revenue for the quarter, churn of customers, and costs\nassociated with development or operations. The chief product officer (CPO) and\ntheir VPs of product are responsible for communicating how the outcomes of\nproduct initiatives have furthered strategic intents, like Karen did at Marquetly.\nNew strategic intents can be introduced in this meeting, as older ones are com-\ning to completion. It is not a place to prioritize new product initiatives or to go\ninto detail on them. That is what the product initiative review is for.\nThe product initiative review  is another quarterly meeting that can be stag-\ngered with the quarterly business review on off months. This meeting is for the\nproduct development side of the house\u2014CPO, CTO, design leaders, the VPs of\nproduct, and the product managers. Here we review the progress of the options\nagainst the product initiatives and adjust our strategy accordingly. This is the\nplace for product managers to talk about the results of preliminary experimenta-\ntion, research, or first releases, as they relate to overall goals. New product initia-\ntives can be introduced in this meeting for feedback and buy-in, along with\nfunding from the product development leadership group. Product teams can ask\nfor more funding to build a first version or to optimize an existing solution.\nRelease reviews provide the opportunity for teams to show off the hard work\nthey have done and to talk about success metrics. These should happen monthly,\nbefore features go out, to showcase what is in the pipeline to be released.",
      "Strategy Deployment\nStrategies are interconnecting stories told throughout the organization that\nexplain the objective and outcomes, tailored to a specific time frame. We call this\nact of communicating and aligning those narratives strategy deployment.\nJabe Bloom, the founder of consulting firm PraxisFlow, works with execu-\ntives to create and deploy strategies at large organizations. He explains why we\nshould think about different levels of strategies as stories at different time scales:\nAt different levels of organizations, we tell stories with different scales of\ntime (timespans), about our work and why we are doing it. In order for\npeople to act on the stories they hear, the stories can\u2019t have significantly\ndifferent time scales than they are accustomed to. Agile teams are really\ngood at telling two- to four-week stories. That\u2019s what they deal with on a\ndaily basis. As you go up in the organization, you tell stories with longer\ntimespans. Executives are really good at telling five-year stories, but a\nteam cannot act on a five-year story when they\u2019re used to thinking in two\nto four weeks. There\u2019s too much space to explore.\nStrategy deployment is about setting the right level of goals and objectives\nthroughout the organization to narrow the playing field so that teams can act. So,\nwhile executives might be looking at a five-year strategy, middle management is\nthinking in smaller strategies\u2014yearly or quarterly\u2014bounding the teams in a\ndirection that allows them to make decisions on a monthly or weekly basis.\nWhen teams are not sufficiently constrained, they become stuck. As Bloom\nexplains:\nThe unconstrained team is the most frightened and scared to act in the\norganization. They feel like they cannot make a decision because there are\ntoo many options. Appropriately constrained teams, ones who have a\ndirection set to the right level for them, feel safe to make decisions\nbecause they can see how their stories align to the goals and structure of\nthe organization.\nNot having the right level of direction lands us in the build trap. Teams are\ngiven instructions that are either too prescriptive or too broad. Executives will get\ntoo far into the weeds, managing by authority and not allowing autonomy. Or\nteams could, as Bloom mentioned, be given so much freedom they are unable to\n74 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP",

Through the 'Product Kata' and research, what did they discover was the actual root cause of low course publication rates, and how did they validate the solution before building software?",
    "response": "The Marquetly team initially believed the root cause of low course publication rates was the \"clumsy workflow\" of their website, which made creating courses time-consuming and difficult for teachers. However, after conducting user research with 20 teachers through one-on-one sessions, they discovered that the actual root cause was the excessive time teachers spent on video editing. This bottleneck prevented them from completing more courses, resulting in low second course publication rates.\n\nTo validate this solution, the team implemented a small experiment where they provided simple-to-use video-editing software to select teachers. They observed an immediate improvement in course publication rates and saw that these courses were reengaging previously checked-out students.

      "Karen went over to Christa, the product manager on the teacher experience,\nto give her the news and set her up to explore the issues with her team.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to walk through the Product Kata in order to set you up for suc-\ncess. So, first, you need to identify your obstacles or customer problems standing\nin the way of teachers creating more content. Let\u2019s regroup in a week and see\nwhat you\u2019ve found around that.\u201d\nChrista enlisted the help of their UX designer and lead engineer to dive\ndeeper. She started off by going over their product initiative and helping them\nunderstand how they got there. Then she explained what they already knew:\n\u201cWhen we did the initial research, we found that a lot of the students were\ninterested in learning new marketing methods. These were things like harness-\ning social media and content creation to drive traffic to the site. So it\u2019s not\nenough just to increase content\u2014we have to be strategic about it. We\u2019ve been get-\nting feedback for months from teachers emailing us for help. A lot of the ques-\ntions are around how to upload information more quickly, and there seems to be\na very clumsy workflow. I\u2019m trying to figure out how widespread the issue is so\nwe can quantify it. What can we do to get data on how many people experience\nthis problem?\u201d\n\u201cI can set up a quick open-ended survey with a text box for our teachers and\nask what is preventing them from doing a second course,\u201d said the UX designer,\nMatt.\n\u201cI can pull session times out of the system from when people start a course\nand when they complete it. We have event timing around this,\u201d Rich, the lead\ndeveloper said.\n\u201cGreat! Let\u2019s take a week and investigate as much as we can. At the end, we\ncan pull together the data and see if this is something worth diving deeper into.\u201d\nThe team got to work. Early the next week, everyone got back together to go\nover the findings. I met up with them to go through their results.\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d Matt said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how poorly the experience was\ndesigned, and the teachers sound incredibly frustrated. It takes them on average,\na month to put together a course, even when they have most of the content\nalready developed.",
      "Solution Exploration\nI met with the team again two weeks later to review what it learned.\n\u201cWe found a bigger problem standing in the way of reaching our goal,\u201d said\nChrista, grinning. \u201cOur teachers are spending upward of 80 hours over two\nmonths editing videos for their class. There are some people who are even\nreshooting the videos over and over again so they don\u2019t have to edit.\u201d\nI was very proud of them. \u201cSee, trying to solve one problem uncovered a big-\nger one. What is the next step?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019re running an experiment to see whether taking on video editing for a\nselect group of our teachers will result in more courses being published from\nthat group,\u201d said Christa. The team began to walk through the Kata to determine\nwhat it needed to learn next.\n\u201cWe know that video editing is a problem for most of our teachers, but we\nneed to learn whether solving this problem will increase the published rate of\ncourses,\u201d said Rich.\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d I said. \u201cNow how do you make that happen?\u201d\nThe team scoped out its experiment. They would pitch the video-editing ser-\nvice to the teachers and help up to 10 of them per week for two weeks. There\nwere two video editors at Marquetly working in its marketing department.\nChrista asked Karen to get buy-in from the VP of marketing to have them help\nexecute on the experiment for two weeks, and he agreed. Together, they deter-\nmined that they could handle about seven courses per week together, in that\namount of time.\nWith that in mind, and already knowing the potential revenue each pub-\nlished course could bring in, Christa set their success metric to be at least 10 of\nthe courses they worked on to be published within a month.\nTwo weeks after launching the experiment, I came back to check on the team\nand see what it learned.\n119\n| 18",

Christa\u2019s team found a big issue in getting more content on our\nsite. Only 25% of teachers who started a course actually published one to our site,\nand only 10% of our teachers publish a second course.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT?! That is insane. I had no idea those were the numbers. That\u2019s terri-\nble,\u201d Chris, the CEO, exclaimed.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s pretty dismal,\u201d Karen agreed. \u201cThe major cause is video editing.\nOur teachers are experts in marketing\u2014not in video editing. They are spending\nupward of 80 hours trying to just edit videos. We ran two small experiments over\nthe last month to help solve this problem, and we were able to increase the pub-\nlish rate from 25% to 75%, by providing our teachers with simple-to-use video-\nediting software. We\u2019re also seeing preliminary trends that say these new courses\nare reengaging previously checked-out students.\u201d\n\u201cThis is incredibly promising. What do we have to do to make this happen\nfor everyone? Can we just implement what you did for the experiment across all\nteachers?\u201d asked the CTO.\n\u201cFrom a monetary standpoint, we can\u2019t afford to provide licenses to all of our\nteachers.

    "response": "**Explanation of Strategic Gaps Identified by Stephen Bungay**\n\n1. **The Knowledge Gap**:  \n   This gap exists between what management aspires to know and what the company actually knows. Typically, organizations attempt to bridge this gap by seeking more information from employees through metrics or data collection. However, according to Bungay, the effective approach is to enable teams to share their knowledge, facilitating the collection of necessary information internally.\n\n2. **The Alignment Gap**:  \n   This gap refers to the discrepancy between what individuals do and what management expects them to achieve business goals. Organizations often fill this by providing detailed instructions or directives from top down. However, Bungay advocates for a different strategy: instead of mandating methods, teams should define their own approaches as long as they align with company objectives.\n\n3. **The Effects Gap**:  \n   This gap is the difference between expected outcomes and actual results. Filling it usually involves adding more controls or monitoring to achieve desired results. However, Bungay suggests allowing teams to adjust their actions based on data to naturally achieve the intended outcomes.\n\n**Focus on The Alignment Gap**:  \nTypically, organizations incorrectly fill this gap by imposing detailed instructions from management downwards. This constrains teams, often leading to resistance and ineffective approaches due to a lack of autonomy. According to Bungay, the correct approach is to align each level around a 'why' (the overall objective) so that the next level can determine the 'how.' Teams should be given freedom to define their methods, ensuring they contribute meaningfully to the company's strategy without unnecessary constraints.\n\nThis structured explanation highlights how understanding and addressing these gaps can lead to more effective strategies in an organization.",

      "Strategic Gaps\nWhile studying strategy in many organizations, Stephen Bungay discovered that,\nwhen companies approach strategy as a plan, they often fail to achieve what they\nexpected.

These gaps ultimately cause friction\nwithin the organization:\n\u2022 The Knowledge Gap\n\u2022 The Alignment Gap\n\u2022 The Effects Gap\nThe Knowledge Gap\nThe Knowledge Gap ( Figure 11-1) is the difference between what management\nwould like to know and what the company actually knows.

      "The Alignment Gap\nThe Alignment Gap, shown in Figure 11-2, is the difference between what people\ndo and what management wants them to do, which is to achieve the business\ngoals. Organizations try to fill this gap by providing more detailed instruction;\nwhereas, instead, they should allow each level within the company to define how\nit will achieve the intent of the next level up.\nFigure 11-2. The Alignment Gap, by Stephen Bungay from the Art of Action (reprinted by per-\nmission of Hodder & Stoughton)\nAt one company, I walked around asking all of the product managers on the\nhundred or so teams why they were working on their current project. I then\nasked their leaders the same question. I got two different answers from these two\ndifferent levels. They could not connect the activities of the teams back to the out-\ncomes of the companies because leadership had passed down feature requests\nrather than expected outcomes and goals. As soon as those feature requests were\ncommitted, it was nearly impossible to change them because the company\nexpected them to be delivered.\nAlthough I\u2019ve witnessed this at many companies, there is one example that\nalways haunts me. I was training product managers at a very large and estab-\nlished company (let\u2019s call it Company B), when I was told that it could not do any\nvalidation work around its products because the solutions the teams were build-\ning were already committed to the leadership of the company. Why? Well, Com-\npany B had hired a huge consulting firm to explore and dictate its product\nroadmap for the next five years. The consultants poured over market research\nSTRATEGIC GAPS | 67",
      "Figure 11-3. The Effects Gap, by Stephen Bungay from the Art of Action (reprinted by permission\nof Hodder & Stoughton)\nAll of these misguided, knee-jerk reactions start to pile up. Instead of align-\ning a team with a framework of goals and direction and then stepping back to\ngive that team the room to explore how to reach the goals, management usually\nswings a complete 180 degrees. It asks for more information. It expects teams to\ncommit to what management wants to do over the next year. It prescribes fully\nthought-out solutions, and then product teams are restricted to only those param-\neters instead of being able to focus on learning and adjusting their decisions as\nthey go.\nTo solve these various gaps and to deliver great products to your customers,\nyou need to view strategy in a different way, and, as Bungay proposes, enable\naction to achieve results. But why do we care about strategy being something that\nenables action? Well, that is how you scale an organization\u2014by enabling action\nthrough autonomous teams.\nAutonomous T eams\nAt Marquetly, the product managers were very frustrated by their lack of\nautonomy. One experienced product manager told me, \u201cI keep having leaders tell\nme to own the vision of my product, but I\u2019m not allowed. My manager keeps\nhanding me solutions. Every time I try to suggest something different, I\u2019m shut\ndown. When we went Agile, we were told that our Scrum teams were supposed\nto be autonomous.

They\nwanted to do right by the customer, but they couldn\u2019t, for fear of losing their jobs.\nAnd so they built the wrong thing\u2014knowingly. At the end of the year, Company\nB missed all of its goals, and the teams were penalized, even though they deliv-\nered on their roadmaps.\nWhen these teams realized that customers did not want the consultant-\nproposed solution, they should have had the freedom to explore alternative\noptions. That is how a product-led organization would operate. This is what\nkeeps us out of the build trap. Instead, their adherence to predetermined meet-\nings and formalities trapped them into staying quiet. Product teams need the\nfreedom to explore solutions and to adjust their actions according to the data they\nreceive. As long as they are aligned with the overall strategic intents and vision\nfor the company, management should feel comfortable granting the necessary\nautonomy to capable teams.\nInstead of sending down mandates, organizations should, instead, turn to\naligning every level of the company around the why and should give the next\nlayer down the opportunity to figure out the how and report back. When done\nthis way, product management is successful. When leadership is not aligned at\nthe top, the issues trickle all the way down to the teams. The lack of meaning and\nfocus spreads, and, at the end of the year, the company will look at their target\ngoals and ask, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lack of leadership alignment is by far the big-\ngest issue I see standing in the way of successful product management.\nThe Effects Gap\nThe Effects Gap ( Figure 11-3 ) is the difference between what we expect our\nactions to achieve and what actually happens.

      "Strategy Deployment\nStrategies are interconnecting stories told throughout the organization that\nexplain the objective and outcomes, tailored to a specific time frame. We call this\nact of communicating and aligning those narratives strategy deployment.\nJabe Bloom, the founder of consulting firm PraxisFlow, works with execu-\ntives to create and deploy strategies at large organizations. He explains why we\nshould think about different levels of strategies as stories at different time scales:\nAt different levels of organizations, we tell stories with different scales of\ntime (timespans), about our work and why we are doing it. In order for\npeople to act on the stories they hear, the stories can\u2019t have significantly\ndifferent time scales than they are accustomed to. Agile teams are really\ngood at telling two- to four-week stories. That\u2019s what they deal with on a\ndaily basis. As you go up in the organization, you tell stories with longer\ntimespans. Executives are really good at telling five-year stories, but a\nteam cannot act on a five-year story when they\u2019re used to thinking in two\nto four weeks. There\u2019s too much space to explore.\nStrategy deployment is about setting the right level of goals and objectives\nthroughout the organization to narrow the playing field so that teams can act. So,\nwhile executives might be looking at a five-year strategy, middle management is\nthinking in smaller strategies\u2014yearly or quarterly\u2014bounding the teams in a\ndirection that allows them to make decisions on a monthly or weekly basis.\nWhen teams are not sufficiently constrained, they become stuck. As Bloom\nexplains:\nThe unconstrained team is the most frightened and scared to act in the\norganization. They feel like they cannot make a decision because there are\ntoo many options. Appropriately constrained teams, ones who have a\ndirection set to the right level for them, feel safe to make decisions\nbecause they can see how their stories align to the goals and structure of\nthe organization.\nNot having the right level of direction lands us in the build trap. Teams are\ngiven instructions that are either too prescriptive or too broad. Executives will get\ntoo far into the weeds, managing by authority and not allowing autonomy. Or\nteams could, as Bloom mentioned, be given so much freedom they are unable to\n74 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP"

The Alignment Gap: The difference between what people do and what management wants them to do. The Effects Gap: The difference between what we expect our actions to achieve and what they actually achieve. Addressing the Alignment Gap: Incorrect Method: Organizations often try to fill this gap by providing more detailed instructions and passing down specific feature requests/mandates. Correct Method: Organizations should allow each level within the company to define how it will achieve the intent of the next level up. Leadership should align every level around the 'why' and give the next layer the freedom to figure out the 'how' (the solution) and report back."
