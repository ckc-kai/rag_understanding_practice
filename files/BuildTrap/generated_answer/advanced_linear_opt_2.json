Product managers, on the other\n26 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\nhand, can\u2019t change many of the things a CEO can in an organization. They espe-\ncially don\u2019t have authority over people, because they are not people managers at\nthe team level. Instead, they need to rely on influencing them to actually move in\na certain direction.\nOut of this wonderful CEO myth emerged an archetype of a very arrogant\nproduct manager who thinks they rule the world. I found one of these types at\nMarquetly. His name was Nick. Nick had just graduated from business school\nand was hired into the company as a product manager. All of the developers\nhated him. The UX designers, too. Why?\nFrankly, Nick was terrible to the designers and developers. He specifically\nwanted to be a product manager because he fancied himself the next Steve Jobs,\na visionary who would dictate, from on high, to his team everything they should\nbuild. Needless to say, the rest of his team didn\u2019t like that very much. He was\nfrustrated. \u201cThe team won\u2019t listen to me. I can\u2019t get them to build what I want.\u201d\nPoor Nick. He just didn\u2019t understand his role.\nI took him aside and said, \u201cLook, I was once just like you, and let me tell you,\nthis mindset does not work out in your favor. I came into OpenSky, our celebrity\ne-commerce site, grabbed on to that manager title, and didn\u2019t want to let go. I\nnever wanted to hear criticism about my own ideas. After all, I was the visionary.\nThis was my JOB. If anyone came to me with another idea, I dismissed it imme-\ndiately. That attitude does not win you friends. And, honestly, I was miserable.\nMy team didn\u2019t want to work with me.\u201d\nI had his attention. I kept going. \u201cSo, one day, my boss took me aside and\ntold me that if I didn\u2019t start winning over the team, I was going to fail. That\u2019s\nwhen I changed my approach. He reminded me that my job was to produce\nvalue, not develop my own ideas.",
      "That\u2019s\nwhen I changed my approach. He reminded me that my job was to produce\nvalue, not develop my own ideas. It wasn\u2019t until I found some humility that I was\nable to create products that people loved. Before that, I was building things that\ndid not produce the desired results for my customers, and no one adopted them.\nI also had an unmotivated team that was slow to deliver because they were not\nbought in.\u201d\nNick sat there and took it in. \u201cI want to do well at this. Tell me what I have to\ndo to get better and build cool products.\u201d\n\u201cStart listening to your team. Involve them. Listen to your customers and\nfocus on their problems instead of your own solutions. Fall in love with those\nproblems. Also, go seek out data to prove and validate your ideas. Turn to con-\ncrete evidence, rather than opinions.\u201d Nick took the advice to heart, and we\nworked on an approach together. He started with involving his team by holding a\nBAD PRODUCT MANAGER ARCHETYPES | 27\n\nbrainstorming session. Within a month, everyone\u2019s opinion of Nick began\nchanging for the better. Then he made sure to follow up with them, ask their\nopinions, and give credit back to the team. He still had to win their trust back,\nbut he was definitely going in the right direction.\nListening to everyone\u2019s opinions is important, but it doesn\u2019t mean a product\nmanager should implement every suggestion. Swinging too far in that direction\nbrings us to the other most common archetype of the product manager: the\nwaiter.\nThe Waiter\nThe waiter is a product manager who, at heart, is an order taker. They go to their\nstakeholders, customers, or managers, ask for what they want, and turn those\nwants into a list of items to be developed. There is no goal. There is no vision.\nThere is no decision making involved. This was the archetype of 90% of the\nproduct owner teams at Marquetly.\nThe most common question I get from product managers in this position is,\n\u201cHow do I prioritize?\u201d Because they have no goal in which to provide context for\ntrade-offs, it becomes a popularity contest for whomever is making the request.\nMore often than not, the most important person gets their features prioritized.",
      "With the increased prominence of Agile\nmethodologies, more and more people are seeing the flaws of a system that takes\nyears to determine whether the given requirements are even the correct ones.\nMany companies, such as our friends at Marquetly, have eagerly adopted\nAgile, thinking it was a silver bullet for creating more value in software, only to\nbe disappointed. Why? Agile does indeed promote a better way of collaboration\nand a faster method of building software, but it largely ignores how to do effec-\ntive product management.\nAgile assumed that someone was doing that front-of-funnel part, generating\nand validating ideas, and instead optimized the production of software. Yet, that\npiece has been lost along the way, as companies believe that Agile is all you need\nto do successful software development. So, many product managers in Agile\norganizations still operate with this Waterfall mindset.\nBeing a great product manager takes a thorough understanding of your\nusers, a careful analysis of your systems, and an ability to see and execute on\nopportunities for your market. When you go through the motions without active\nthinking, you end up with a lot of useless features. We rarely teach product man-\nagers how to think, and, even if we do, we don\u2019t measure this thinking for suc-\ncess. Instead, we are praised for writing detailed specifications or for making\nsure the developers are shipping on time.\nWhen I ask people how they would define a product manager, I get lots of\ndifferent answers\u2014even from product managers themselves. \u201cProduct managers\nare the ones who come up with the ideas for what to build!\u201d Or, \u201cThey are the\nvoice of the customer!\u201d And always, \u201cA product manager is the CEO of the prod-\nuct!\u201d\nTo understand what the product manager\u2019s role is not, you need to under-\nstand the common archetypes of bad product managers.

Before that, I was building things that\ndid not produce the desired results for my customers, and no one adopted them.\nI also had an unmotivated team that was slow to deliver because they were not\nbought in.\u201d\nNick sat there and took it in. \u201cI want to do well at this. Tell me what I have to\ndo to get better and build cool products.\u201d\n\u201cStart listening to your team. Involve them. Listen to your customers and\nfocus on their problems instead of your own solutions. Fall in love with those\nproblems. Also, go seek out data to prove and validate your ideas. Turn to con-\ncrete evidence, rather than opinions.\u201d Nick took the advice to heart, and we\nworked on an approach together. He started with involving his team by holding a\nBAD PRODUCT MANAGER ARCHETYPES | 27\n\nbrainstorming session. Within a month, everyone\u2019s opinion of Nick began\nchanging for the better. Then he made sure to follow up with them, ask their\nopinions, and give credit back to the team. He still had to win their trust back,\nbut he was definitely going in the right direction.\nListening to everyone\u2019s opinions is important, but it doesn\u2019t mean a product\nmanager should implement every suggestion. Swinging too far in that direction\nbrings us to the other most common archetype of the product manager: the\nwaiter.\nThe Waiter\nThe waiter is a product manager who, at heart, is an order taker. They go to their\nstakeholders, customers, or managers, ask for what they want, and turn those\nwants into a list of items to be developed. There is no goal. There is no vision.\nThere is no decision making involved. This was the archetype of 90% of the\nproduct owner teams at Marquetly.\nThe most common question I get from product managers in this position is,\n\u201cHow do I prioritize?\u201d Because they have no goal in which to provide context for\ntrade-offs, it becomes a popularity contest for whomever is making the request.\nMore often than not, the most important person gets their features prioritized.",
      "With the increased prominence of Agile\nmethodologies, more and more people are seeing the flaws of a system that takes\nyears to determine whether the given requirements are even the correct ones.\nMany companies, such as our friends at Marquetly, have eagerly adopted\nAgile, thinking it was a silver bullet for creating more value in software, only to\nbe disappointed. Why? Agile does indeed promote a better way of collaboration\nand a faster method of building software, but it largely ignores how to do effec-\ntive product management.\nAgile assumed that someone was doing that front-of-funnel part, generating\nand validating ideas, and instead optimized the production of software. Yet, that\npiece has been lost along the way, as companies believe that Agile is all you need\nto do successful software development. So, many product managers in Agile\norganizations still operate with this Waterfall mindset.\nBeing a great product manager takes a thorough understanding of your\nusers, a careful analysis of your systems, and an ability to see and execute on\nopportunities for your market. When you go through the motions without active\nthinking, you end up with a lot of useless features. We rarely teach product man-\nagers how to think, and, even if we do, we don\u2019t measure this thinking for suc-\ncess. Instead, we are praised for writing detailed specifications or for making\nsure the developers are shipping on time.\nWhen I ask people how they would define a product manager, I get lots of\ndifferent answers\u2014even from product managers themselves. \u201cProduct managers\nare the ones who come up with the ideas for what to build!\u201d Or, \u201cThey are the\nvoice of the customer!\u201d And always, \u201cA product manager is the CEO of the prod-\nuct!\u201d\nTo understand what the product manager\u2019s role is not, you need to under-\nstand the common archetypes of bad product managers. Let\u2019s begin with that last\none, given that I particularly hate it.\nThe Mini-CEO\nProduct managers are not the mini-CEOs of a product, yet 90% of the job post-\nings I have seen for product managers describe them as being the mini-CEO.\nCEOs have sole authority over many things. They can fire people. They can\nchange up teams. They can change directions."

      "\nQuestion: To address the Strategic Gaps identified by Stephen Bungay, we can break down each component as follows:\n\n1. **Knowledge Gap**: This refers to an organization's deficiency in expertise within a critical domain necessary for achieving strategic objectives. When such gaps exist, they hinder progress and effectiveness.\n\n2. **Alignment Gap**: This occurs when organizational strategies and actions are not aligned with their overall objectives. Typically, organizations may address this gap incorrectly by rushing into projects without proper planning, leading to misaligned goals or ineffective strategies. They might set high-level objectives without translating them into actionable plans, resulting in underutilized resources or failed initiatives.\n\n3. **Effects Gap**: This pertains to the inability of an organization to measure the outcomes of its strategic decisions and initiatives. Without understanding these effects, success is hard to assess, and necessary adjustments are difficult to make.\n\n**For the Alignment Gap:**\n- **Typical Incorrect Approach**: Organizations often fail to invest sufficient time in planning or ensure that their strategies match their objectives. They might rush into projects without a structured plan, leading to misalignment.\n- **Correct Approach According to Bungay**: Organizations should adopt a more structured approach by setting clear, measurable objectives closely aligned with strategic goals. Involving key stakeholders early on and using robust frameworks for translating strategies into actionable plans are essential.\n\nIn summary, organizations can address the Alignment Gap by focusing on thorough planning, stakeholder involvement, and structured methods to ensure their actions align with strategic goals, thereby avoiding typical missteps that lead to underutilized resources or failed initiatives.\nAnswer: **Answer: Addressing the Alignment Gap**\n\nThe **Alignment Gap**, as identified by Stephen Bungay in \"The Art of Action,\" refers to the situation where organizational strategies and actions are not closely aligned with overall company objectives. Typically, organizations may address this gap incorrectly by rushing into projects without proper planning or failing to translate high-level strategic goals into actionable plans, leading to misaligned resources or failed initiatives.\n\nTo effectively address the Alignment Gap, organizations should adopt a structured approach:\n\n1. **Set Clear, Measurable Objectives**: Ensure that strategies are closely tied to specific, measurable objectives aligned with strategic goals. This alignment helps guide decision-making and resource allocation efficiently.\n\n2. **Involve Key Stakeholders Early**: Engage stakeholders in the planning process early on. Their insights help shape the strategy, ensuring it resonates with both internal processes and external needs.\n\n3. **Use Robust Frameworks**: Implement structured frameworks such as Agile methodology to translate strategies into actionable plans. These frameworks promote transparency, adaptability, and effective stakeholder collaboration, enabling teams to align their efforts with organizational objectives.\n\nBy focusing on these steps, organizations can avoid typical missteps that lead to underutilized resources or failed initiatives, ensuring that actions are consistently aligned with strategic goals for sustainable success.",

      "This was the core problem it needed to understand\nbefore coming up with the right solution. The company needed room to experi-\nment and to understand why before it could suggest how to solve the problem.\nConsider a product manager telling you the following: \u201cI\u2019m building this\nbecause it\u2019s going to help increase acquisitions, and new customer-acquisition is\nour big goal to drive the revenue prioritized at the corporate level. I know my\nproduct can bring people in. We know there\u2019s a problem here, but we\u2019re not sure\nwhat it is yet. Our next step is to discover that problem, tackle it with a solution,\nand then try to optimize the solution so we can increase acquisition.\u201d That\u2019s\nsomeone telling the story. A product manager who told you this should inspire\nconfidence. Unfortunately, the opposite is usually true.\nLeaders will still go through the ranks demanding more detailed informa-\ntion. Often, this is perceived as a lack of trust, and often it is, but there\u2019s usually\nsomething more there. In every organization where I\u2019ve seen leaders operate this\nway, the story is not complete. Typically, there\u2019s a lack of alignment, and the\ngoals of the team do not line up to an overall vision and strategy of the company.\nThis Alignment Gap is what truly causes the demand for more and more infor-\nmation.\n66 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\nThe Alignment Gap\nThe Alignment Gap, shown in Figure 11-2, is the difference between what people\ndo and what management wants them to do, which is to achieve the business\ngoals. Organizations try to fill this gap by providing more detailed instruction;\nwhereas, instead, they should allow each level within the company to define how\nit will achieve the intent of the next level up.\nFigure 11-2.

They could not connect the activities of the teams back to the out-\ncomes of the companies because leadership had passed down feature requests\nrather than expected outcomes and goals.",
      "Instead of sending down mandates, organizations should, instead, turn to\naligning every level of the company around the why and should give the next\nlayer down the opportunity to figure out the how and report back. When done\nthis way, product management is successful. When leadership is not aligned at\nthe top, the issues trickle all the way down to the teams. The lack of meaning and\nfocus spreads, and, at the end of the year, the company will look at their target\ngoals and ask, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lack of leadership alignment is by far the big-\ngest issue I see standing in the way of successful product management.\nThe Effects Gap\nThe Effects Gap (Figure 11-3) is the difference between what we expect our\nactions to achieve and what actually happens. When organizations do not see the\nresults they want, they try to fill this gap by putting more controls in place. How-\never, that is the worst thing you can do in this scenario. Giving individuals and\nteams the freedom to adjust their actions so that they are in line with their goals\nis what will truly allow them to achieve results.\n68 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\nFigure 11-3. The Effects Gap, by Stephen Bungay from the Art of Action (reprinted by permission\nof Hodder & Stoughton)\nAll of these misguided, knee-jerk reactions start to pile up. Instead of align-\ning a team with a framework of goals and direction and then stepping back to\ngive that team the room to explore how to reach the goals, management usually\nswings a complete 180 degrees. It asks for more information. It expects teams to\ncommit to what management wants to do over the next year. It prescribes fully\nthought-out solutions, and then product teams are restricted to only those param-\neters instead of being able to focus on learning and adjusting their decisions as\nthey go.\nTo solve these various gaps and to deliver great products to your customers,\nyou need to view strategy in a different way, and, as Bungay proposes, enable\naction to achieve results. But why do we care about strategy being something that\nenables action? Well, that is how you scale an organization\u2014by enabling action\nthrough autonomous teams.\nAutonomous Teams\nAt Marquetly, the product managers were very frustrated by their lack of\nautonomy.",
      "Well, that is how you scale an organization\u2014by enabling action\nthrough autonomous teams.\nAutonomous Teams\nAt Marquetly, the product managers were very frustrated by their lack of\nautonomy. One experienced product manager told me, \u201cI keep having leaders tell\nme to own the vision of my product, but I\u2019m not allowed. My manager keeps\nhanding me solutions. Every time I try to suggest something different, I\u2019m shut\ndown. When we went Agile, we were told that our Scrum teams were supposed\nto be autonomous. This is definitely not autonomy.\u201d\nSTRATEGIC GAPS | 69\n\nTalking to the leaders of Marquetly, I heard a different story. \u201cOur product\nmanagers won\u2019t step up and own the product. I have to keep prescribing things\nfor them, but it\u2019s because they don\u2019t take initiative.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an interesting dichotomy but a common one I\u2019ve seen in companies\nstuck in the build trap. These are all symptoms of not having a good strategy\nframework that enables action. When teams are not aligned with a clear direction\nand goals, they cannot effectively make decisions. If they dare to try, much of the\ntime, the leader steps in and says, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not right.\u201d\nAutonomy is what allows organizations to scale. The alternative is hiring\nhundreds or thousands of middle managers that lead by authority, telling people\nwhat to do. As organizations grow to the thousands\u2014or even tens of thousands\n\u2014of employees, this becomes incredibly inefficient and costly. It also causes\nunnecessary layers in management and a lot of frustration. People end up\nunhappy, and unhappy people rarely produce great work.\nLeading by authority is a relic of industrial-age methodologies\u2014when low-\nskilled workers were supervised closely so that their output was maximized. In\nthe world of software, we don\u2019t work this way. We\u2019re hiring incredibly smart peo-\nple and paying them hundreds of thousands of dollars to make the decisions on\nhow to grow companies by making complex software that customers love. When\nyou have that sort of talent, you need to give them the room to make decisions so\nthat you can get the full benefit of their knowledge and skill.\nThat\u2019s what a strategic framework promotes.",

They weren\u2019t tied to any outcome\u2014\neither business or user-oriented.\nWe reflected on the company\u2019s current strategy process and how it got to\nthese goals. When the company went into its planning meetings in November,\neveryone would emerge with a list of features to build and then dole them out to\nthe product managers. The product managers then were responsible for estimat-\ning the amount of time it would take to complete the features with their develop-\nment counterparts. After reporting these estimates back to the leadership team,\nthey would then plan the budget and organize the roadmap.\nGoals were set on the leadership level, as well. They had revenue targets they\nwere promising to investors, based on entering this enterprise market. There\nwere usage metrics set to measure whether people continued to use the site.\nEvery part of the organization was measuring something, and yet, for the past\nfew years, the company was not meeting its goals. The revenue targets fell short.\nThe teams could not deliver some of the promised features. What happened?\nThe company was not correctly deploying and creating strategy. The telltale\nsigns were there\u2014all things Jen picked up on in her first week. The leadership\nteam was prioritizing the work itself, based on what it thought was right to build\nrather than on feedback from customers. It was reacting to the customers that\nscreamed the loudest instead of evaluating whether those requests matched the\nstrategic objectives. The morale of the company was low, and, because of that,\nemployees were not producing.\nSo the company decided to change. It decided to create and deploy a strategy\nthat would work with modern product management methods.\nA good company strategy should be made up of two parts: the operational\nframework, or how to keep the day-to-day activities of a company moving; and\nthe strategic framework, or how the company realizes the vision through product\nand service development in the market. Many companies confuse these two\nframeworks and treat them as one and the same. Although both are important,\ngetting the strategic framework right is essential for developing great products\nand services. That\u2019s what we talk about in the next chapters, because it is what\ndirectly influences product management.\nThis strategic framework aligns the company\u2019s strategy and vision with the\nproducts that are developed by the teams.",

      "Instead of sending down mandates, organizations should, instead, turn to\naligning every level of the company around the why and should give the next\nlayer down the opportunity to figure out the how and report back. When done\nthis way, product management is successful. When leadership is not aligned at\nthe top, the issues trickle all the way down to the teams. The lack of meaning and\nfocus spreads, and, at the end of the year, the company will look at their target\ngoals and ask, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lack of leadership alignment is by far the big-\ngest issue I see standing in the way of successful product management.\nThe Effects Gap\nThe Effects Gap (Figure 11-3) is the difference between what we expect our\nactions to achieve and what actually happens. When organizations do not see the\nresults they want, they try to fill this gap by putting more controls in place. How-\never, that is the worst thing you can do in this scenario. Giving individuals and\nteams the freedom to adjust their actions so that they are in line with their goals\nis what will truly allow them to achieve results.\n68 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\nFigure 11-3. The Effects Gap, by Stephen Bungay from the Art of Action (reprinted by permission\nof Hodder & Stoughton)\nAll of these misguided, knee-jerk reactions start to pile up. Instead of align-\ning a team with a framework of goals and direction and then stepping back to\ngive that team the room to explore how to reach the goals, management usually\nswings a complete 180 degrees. It asks for more information. It expects teams to\ncommit to what management wants to do over the next year. It prescribes fully\nthought-out solutions, and then product teams are restricted to only those param-\neters instead of being able to focus on learning and adjusting their decisions as\nthey go.\nTo solve these various gaps and to deliver great products to your customers,\nyou need to view strategy in a different way, and, as Bungay proposes, enable\naction to achieve results. But why do we care about strategy being something that\nenables action? Well, that is how you scale an organization\u2014by enabling action\nthrough autonomous teams.\nAutonomous Teams\nAt Marquetly, the product managers were very frustrated by their lack of\nautonomy.",
      "Strategic Gaps\nWhile studying strategy in many organizations, Stephen Bungay discovered that,\nwhen companies approach strategy as a plan, they often fail to achieve what they\nexpected. This failure stems from the actions taken to fill the following gaps that\nexist between outcomes, plans, and actions. These gaps ultimately cause friction\nwithin the organization:\n\u2022 The Knowledge Gap\n\u2022 The Alignment Gap\n\u2022 The Effects Gap\nThe Knowledge Gap\nThe Knowledge Gap (Figure 11-1) is the difference between what management\nwould like to know and what the company actually knows. Organizations try to\nfill this gap by providing and demanding more detailed information.\nFigure 11-1. The Knowledge Gap, by Stephen Bungay from the Art of Action (reprinted by per-\nmission of Hodder & Stoughton)\n65\n| 11\n\nIf you\u2019re a leader saying to yourself, \u201cOh, damn, that\u2019s me,\u201d you are not\nalone. These were the exact words that popped out of the mouth of a CEO when I\nintroduced this concept to him. This issue is probably the most readily recogniza-\nble of the gaps.\nWe also saw this gap surface with the CTO of Marquetly. He demanded that\nwe lay out every single detail of a not-yet-validated product so that he could feel\nmore certain about what we were doing. A deluge of information isn\u2019t always that\nhelpful for upper management. You need to focus on communicating and asking\nfor just enough information to make a decision.\nInstead of seeking more detailed information, upper management should be\nlimiting its direction to defining and communicating the strategic intent, or the\ngoals of the business. The strategic intents combine to communicate where the\ncompany is heading and what it desires to achieve when it gets there. The strate-\ngic intent points the team toward the outcomes the businesses wants to achieve.\nIn the case with Marquetly, there were too many unknowns at the time to\nmake a detailed plan. It still did not understand why users were falling off at cer-\ntain steps of the sign-up flow. This was the core problem it needed to understand\nbefore coming up with the right solution. The company needed room to experi-\nment and to understand why before it could suggest how to solve the problem.",
      "I got two different answers from these two\ndifferent levels. They could not connect the activities of the teams back to the out-\ncomes of the companies because leadership had passed down feature requests\nrather than expected outcomes and goals. As soon as those feature requests were\ncommitted, it was nearly impossible to change them because the company\nexpected them to be delivered.\nAlthough I\u2019ve witnessed this at many companies, there is one example that\nalways haunts me. I was training product managers at a very large and estab-\nlished company (let\u2019s call it Company B), when I was told that it could not do any\nvalidation work around its products because the solutions the teams were build-\ning were already committed to the leadership of the company. Why? Well, Com-\npany B had hired a huge consulting firm to explore and dictate its product\nroadmap for the next five years. The consultants poured over market research\nSTRATEGIC GAPS | 67\n\nand competitive analyses and came up with a roadmap, which then trickled down\nto the teams.\nThese teams, meanwhile, had been talking to customers and knew that these\nsolutions the consultants had come up with were not what customers wanted.\nYet their performance reviews were based on delivering those products. They\nwanted to do right by the customer, but they couldn\u2019t, for fear of losing their jobs.\nAnd so they built the wrong thing\u2014knowingly. At the end of the year, Company\nB missed all of its goals, and the teams were penalized, even though they deliv-\nered on their roadmaps.\nWhen these teams realized that customers did not want the consultant-\nproposed solution, they should have had the freedom to explore alternative\noptions. That is how a product-led organization would operate. This is what\nkeeps us out of the build trap. Instead, their adherence to predetermined meet-\nings and formalities trapped them into staying quiet. Product teams need the\nfreedom to explore solutions and to adjust their actions according to the data they\nreceive. As long as they are aligned with the overall strategic intents and vision\nfor the company, management should feel comfortable granting the necessary\nautonomy to capable teams.\nInstead of sending down mandates, organizations should, instead, turn to\naligning every level of the company around the why and should give the next\nlayer down the opportunity to figure out the how and report back.",
