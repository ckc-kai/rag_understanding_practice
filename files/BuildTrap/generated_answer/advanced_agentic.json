    "ground_truth": "The build trap is when organizations become stuck measuring their success by outputs rather than outcomes. It occurs when they focus more on shipping and developing features rather than on the actual value those things produce."

    "question": "The text outlines three 'Bad Product Manager Archetypes.' List them and briefly explain the 'Waiter' archetype.",
    "answer": "The three 'Bad Product Manager Archetypes' mentioned in the text are the Mini-CEO, the Waiter, and the Former Project Manager. The Waiter archetype is a bad product manager who lacks a goal or vision for the product and prioritizes features based on popularity rather than strategic thinking, essentially acting as an order taker.",
    "contexts": [
      "No context retrieved."
    ],
    "ground_truth": "The three archetypes are: 1.The Mini-CEO; 2.The Waiter; 3.The Former Project Manager. The Waiter is a product manager who is, at heart, an order taker. They go to stakeholders, customers, or managers, ask for what they want, and turn those wants into a list of items to be developed. They have no goal, no vision, and no decision-making involvement; they often struggle to prioritize because it becomes a popularity contest."

    "question": "What are the four levels of 'Strategy Deployment' described in the text, and who is responsible for the 'Strategic Intent' level?",
    "answer": "The four levels of 'Strategy Deployment' described in the text are Vision, Strategic Intent, Product Initiatives, and Options. The person responsible for the 'Strategic Intent' level is typically at the company level, but it's not specified who exactly that person is.",

    "ground_truth": "1. Vision (What do we want to be in 5\u201310 years?);. 2. Strategic Intent (What business challenges are standing in our way?); 3. Product Initiative (What problems can we address to tackle the challenge?); 4. Options (What are the different ways we can address those problems?)"

    "question": "In the Marquetly case study regarding the teacher platform, the team initially thought the problem was the 'clumsy workflow' of the website. Through the 'Product Kata' and research, what did they discover was the actual root cause of low course publication rates, and how did they validate the solution before building software?",
    "answer": "Through the 'Product Kata' and research, the team discovered that the actual root cause of low course publication rates was not the \"clumsy workflow\" as initially thought, but rather teachers' lack of knowledge on creating engaging online class videos, which led them to spend excessive time editing videos. They validated this solution by observing how much time teachers were spending on video editing and conducting research to understand their needs and pain points.",
    "contexts": [
      "No context retrieved."
    ],
    "ground_truth": "Actual Root Cause: The team discovered that video editing was the biggest pain point. Teachers were spending upward of 80 hours over two months editing videos, or reshooting them to avoid editing, because they were marketing experts, not video experts. Validation: They ran a Concierge Experiment. The team pitched a video-editing service to teachers and manually edited videos for them for two weeks. This resulted in a publish rate increase from 25% to 75%, validating that solving the video editing problem would achieve their business goals."

    "question": "Explain the 'Strategic Gaps' identified by Stephen Bungay (The Knowledge Gap, The Alignment Gap, and The Effects Gap). For the 'Alignment Gap,' describe how organizations typically try to fill it incorrectly versus what they should do according to the text.",
    "answer": "The 'Alignment Gap' refers to the difference between what people do within an organization and what management wants them to do, which is to achieve business goals. Organizations typically try to fill this gap by providing more detailed instructions, but instead, they should allow each level within the company to define how it will achieve the intent of the next level up. This involves aligning every level around the \"why\" and giving the next layer down the opportunity to figure out the \"how\" and report back, allowing for autonomy at each level and enabling teams to achieve results by adjusting their actions in line with their goals.",
    "contexts": [
      "No context retrieved."
    ],
    "ground_truth": "The Knowledge Gap: The difference between what management would like to know and what the company actually knows. The Alignment Gap: The difference between what people do and what management wants them to do. The Effects Gap: The difference between what we expect our actions to achieve and what they actually achieve. Addressing the Alignment Gap: Incorrect Method: Organizations often try to fill this gap by providing more detailed instructions and passing down specific feature requests/mandates. Correct Method: Organizations should allow each level within the company to define how it will achieve the intent of the next level up. Leadership should align every level around the 'why' and give the next layer the freedom to figure out the 'how' (the solution) and report back."
