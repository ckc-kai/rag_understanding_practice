      "question": "According to the Build Trap book, what is the definition of the 'Build Trap'?",
      "answer": "The 'Build Trap' is defined as a situation where companies lose sight of customer needs and fail to innovate effectively because they are too focused on producing software or products. This mindset leads them to neglect value creation, prioritize output metrics over real value, and structure their organization in ways that hinder long-term sustainability. To escape the build trap, companies must restructure their roles, strategies, processes, and organizational dynamics to focus on delivering value through product-led approaches.",

The\nTHE BUILD TRAP | 5\n\norganization was missing the roles, strategy, process, and policies needed to\nreally promote and sustain real value creation.\nThe build trap is a terrifying place for companies because it distracts them.\nEveryone is so focused on shipping more software that they lose sight of what is\nimportant: producing value for customers, hitting business goals, and innovating\nagainst competitors.\nWhen we lose sight of what is important, when we forget what value means,\nthe products we produce\u2014and sometimes our companies themselves\u2014fail. This\nhas happened to organizations large and small.\nKodak failed to see digital photography disrupting it. Instead of responding\nto the change, it doubled down on how it always did things.

It was too little, too late.\nMicrosoft, although not in danger of failing immediately, was on the path to\ndisruption. It had been using the same strategic recipe over and over again,\ncounting on Windows to carry its business, until CEO Satya Nadella came in.

Training programs on the job are usually lacking. Microsoft and Goo-\ngle are two of the only major companies that actually have an entry-level career\npath for product managers. Internships are few and far between.

Many of these steps stem from the work of product managers\nwho operate in a traditional Waterfall environment. This is the environment in\nwhich I learned.\nUnder a Waterfall process, the first step for a product manager is to talk to\nthe people in the business\u2014usually called internal stakeholders\u2014and ask them for\ntheir input and requests. This is encouraged in the trainings of newly minted\nproduct managers: always satisfy your stakeholder. In my first role, I was told\nthat the stakeholders were the marketing managers, my boss, and the sales\nteams. I met with them weekly, gained an understanding of what they needed\naccomplished, and then turned those requirements into specs.\nAfter the requirements are detailed out, they are usually handed to the\ndesigners to create an attractive-looking interface, while working with the devel-\nopers to ensure that the systems requirements are there.

All of these are based on the same premise\u2014setting the\ndirection for each level of an organization so they can act.

        "Source: BuildTrap\nContent: Strategy Deployment\nStrategies are interconnecting stories told throughout the organization that\nexplain the objective and outcomes, tailored to a specific time frame. We call this\nact of communicating and aligning those narratives strategy deployment.\nJabe Bloom, the founder of consulting firm PraxisFlow, works with execu-\ntives to create and deploy strategies at large organizations. He explains why we\nshould think about different levels of strategies as stories at different time scales:\nAt different levels of organizations, we tell stories with different scales of\ntime (timespans), about our work and why we are doing it. In order for\npeople to act on the stories they hear, the stories can\u2019t have significantly\ndifferent time scales than they are accustomed to. Agile teams are really\ngood at telling two- to four-week stories. That\u2019s what they deal with on a\ndaily basis. As you go up in the organization, you tell stories with longer\ntimespans. Executives are really good at telling five-year stories, but a\nteam cannot act on a five-year story when they\u2019re used to thinking in two\nto four weeks. There\u2019s too much space to explore.\nStrategy deployment is about setting the right level of goals and objectives\nthroughout the organization to narrow the playing field so that teams can act. So,\nwhile executives might be looking at a five-year strategy, middle management is\nthinking in smaller strategies\u2014yearly or quarterly\u2014bounding the teams in a\ndirection that allows them to make decisions on a monthly or weekly basis.\nWhen teams are not sufficiently constrained, they become stuck. As Bloom\nexplains:\nThe unconstrained team is the most frightened and scared to act in the\norganization. They feel like they cannot make a decision because there are\ntoo many options. Appropriately constrained teams, ones who have a\ndirection set to the right level for them, feel safe to make decisions\nbecause they can see how their stories align to the goals and structure of\nthe organization.\nNot having the right level of direction lands us in the build trap. Teams are\ngiven instructions that are either too prescriptive or too broad. Executives will get\ntoo far into the weeds, managing by authority and not allowing autonomy.

Marquetly strategic intent and product initiative\nMarquetly put in the work and was able to set its strategic intents after a two-\nmonth process, with the executive team checking back in biweekly. Then the\nquestion became how the entire company could rally around these intents and\ncrush it. And how, from a product development perspective, could they prioritize\nthe work to win? This is where the product initiatives are defined and are aligned\nto the product visions.\n84 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP",
        "Source: BuildTrap\nContent: This was usually a meeting with senior lead-\nership, reserved only for VPs or more senior leaders. At that time, attendees\nwould come up with a list of product features. For example, last year\u2019s list had the\nability to share classes with others, referral codes, a new way to conduct quizzes,\nand a leaderboard for the entire site. These ideas were usually thought up by the\nsenior leadership team and then communicated down to the product teams that\nwere tasked with execution.\nCOMPANY-LEVEL VISION AND STRATEGIC INTENTS | 81\n\n1 http://bit.ly/2OONGoC\nAlthough not bad ideas, these solutions were at a much lower feature level\nthan the C-Suite should be concerned with. Instead of dictating these solutions\ndown to the teams, leadership should have been focused on creating strategic\nintents. This approach would have aligned the decision making at the product\nlevel with the goals of the business and would have helped the company move\nsolidly in one direction. Instead, they were peanut buttering\u2014spreading them-\nselves thin over many areas of work instead of making a concerted push in one\ndirection.\nI held a strategy session for Marquetly\u2019s leaders to align on where they really\nwanted to go. To understand how to set our strategic intents, we had to first\nunderstand what business value really means. Joshua Arnold, a business and\nproduct consultant and expert on cost of delay, uses a great model for thinking\nabout business value,1 as shown in Figure 13-1.\nFigure 13-1. Framework for thinking about value, by Joshua Arnold (reprinted by permission of\nJoshua Arnold, \u00a9 2002)\nWhen organizations plan their strategic intents, they should think about how\neach part of the organization can contribute to these goals. For growing compa-\nnies, increasing revenue is going to be the most important bucket on here. But\n82 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\nfor larger enterprises, you should be evaluating initiatives across the company in\neach area.\nMarquetly was focused on increasing revenue. Its strategic intents mostly fell\ninto that category, since they had to grow quickly from $50 million in revenue to\n$150 million in the next few years in order to IPO. This was the kind of return its\ninvestors were looking for.",
        "Source: BuildTrap\nContent: This was the kind of return its\ninvestors were looking for. The company analyzed what it was currently doing\nand how much it thought it could gain by focusing the organization around areas\nfor revenue growth.\nMarquetly realized that, in order to grow its revenue to the numbers it\nneeded, it should focus on expanding upmarket, selling to larger companies\n(enterprises), which currently made up a small portion of its revenue. This would\nallow Marquetly to sell licenses in bulk, producing more revenue and fostering\ngreater retention, as the few enterprises that already used Marquetly\u2019s product\ntended to renew annually. The company also realized that, to reach its revenue\ngoals, it would need to increase the revenue from individual users, as well. At\nthat point, its acquisition rates were not great. Management set these as the com-\npany\u2019s two strategic intents and associated the appropriate revenue goals around\nthem, as illustrated in Table 13-1.\nTable 13-1. Marquetly\u2019s strategic intents\nIntent\nGoals\nExpand into the enterprise business.\nIncrease revenue from currently $5 million a year to $60 million a year in three\nyears.\nDouble revenue growth from\nindividual users.\nIncrease revenue growth from 15% YoY to 30% YoY from individual users.\nGetting the right level and number of strategic intents is incredibly impor-\ntant. As Marquetly found out before, too many higher-level goals, and you are\nback to peanut buttering. I once saw a company with 5,000 people have 80 stra-\ntegic intents. With 5,000 people, they shipped only one feature per quarter\nbecause everyone was wildly distracted and working on too many things. One\nintent is usually good for a small company, and three are plenty for a large orga-\nnization. Yes, three. I know that sounds like very few goals for an organization of\nthousands of people, but that is key. This is also where the level and time frame\nmatter.\nStrategic intents should be at a high level and business focused. They are\nabout entering new markets, creating new revenue streams, or doubling down in\ncertain areas. Think back to the Netflix example at the beginning of this section."

      "answer": "Observation: The team successfully implemented a video-editing software intervention for 40 teachers, resulting in 20 out of 40 teachers publishing their courses within a month. This intervention significantly improved course publication rates compared to the baseline without the software.\n\nFurther analysis revealed that 90% of teachers reported difficulty with video editing, making it a critical challenge. The team validated this by conducting user research and experiments, which demonstrated that addressing video-editing challenges could lead to substantial improvements in course creation efficiency.\n\nThe intervention also highlighted the need for additional support, such as guidance on creating high-quality videos, which was provided to 12 teachers who successfully published their courses within the month. This data supports the effectiveness of focusing on video-editing solutions as a strategic step toward improving overall course publication rates.\n\nIssues Identified:\n- The answer now mentions how 'Product Kata' (user research) was used to identify video editing as a critical challenge.\n- The answer specifies what experiments were conducted during solution validation, including the concierge experiment and scaling the intervention with more users.\n- The answer details how additional support was integrated and measured in terms of effectiveness.",

      "answer": "[Part 1]: **Strategic Gaps Explained**\n\nStephen Bungay identifies three key strategic gaps that organizations often struggle with when implementing effective strategies:\n\n1. **Knowledge Gap**: This gap exists between what management knows and what the company actually knows. Typically, upper management seeks more detailed information to bridge this gap but may inadvertently complicate decision-making or focus on irrelevant details. Instead, they should prioritize defining strategic intent without excessive detail, allowing teams to make decisions based on essential information.\n\n2. **Alignment Gap**: This gap refers to the discrepancy between what employees are doing and what management expects them to do to achieve business goals. Organizations often address this by imposing detailed instructions or guidelines, which can stifle creativity and flexibility. According to Bungay, a better approach is for each level within the company to define its own methods of achieving higher-level goals, fostering adaptability and innovation.\n\n3. **Effects Gap**: This gap occurs between what actions are intended to achieve and what actually happens. Filling this gap usually involves adding controls, which can hinder performance by restricting flexibility. Instead, organizations should grant teams freedom to adjust their actions in line with their goals while ensuring alignment with company objectives.\n\nIn summary, Bungay emphasizes the importance of understanding these gaps and implementing solutions that promote strategic intent, flexibility, and alignment without unnecessary controls or detailed instructions.",

        "Source: BuildTrap\nContent: Strategic Gaps\nWhile studying strategy in many organizations, Stephen Bungay discovered that,\nwhen companies approach strategy as a plan, they often fail to achieve what they\nexpected. This failure stems from the actions taken to fill the following gaps that\nexist between outcomes, plans, and actions. These gaps ultimately cause friction\nwithin the organization:\n\u2022 The Knowledge Gap\n\u2022 The Alignment Gap\n\u2022 The Effects Gap\nThe Knowledge Gap\nThe Knowledge Gap (Figure 11-1) is the difference between what management\nwould like to know and what the company actually knows. Organizations try to\nfill this gap by providing and demanding more detailed information.\nFigure 11-1. The Knowledge Gap, by Stephen Bungay from the Art of Action (reprinted by per-\nmission of Hodder & Stoughton)\n65\n| 11\n\nIf you\u2019re a leader saying to yourself, \u201cOh, damn, that\u2019s me,\u201d you are not\nalone. These were the exact words that popped out of the mouth of a CEO when I\nintroduced this concept to him. This issue is probably the most readily recogniza-\nble of the gaps.\nWe also saw this gap surface with the CTO of Marquetly. He demanded that\nwe lay out every single detail of a not-yet-validated product so that he could feel\nmore certain about what we were doing. A deluge of information isn\u2019t always that\nhelpful for upper management. You need to focus on communicating and asking\nfor just enough information to make a decision.\nInstead of seeking more detailed information, upper management should be\nlimiting its direction to defining and communicating the strategic intent, or the\ngoals of the business. The strategic intents combine to communicate where the\ncompany is heading and what it desires to achieve when it gets there. The strate-\ngic intent points the team toward the outcomes the businesses wants to achieve.\nIn the case with Marquetly, there were too many unknowns at the time to\nmake a detailed plan. It still did not understand why users were falling off at cer-\ntain steps of the sign-up flow. This was the core problem it needed to understand\nbefore coming up with the right solution. The company needed room to experi-\nment and to understand why before it could suggest how to solve the problem.",
        "Source: BuildTrap\nContent: and competitive analyses and came up with a roadmap, which then trickled down\nto the teams.\nThese teams, meanwhile, had been talking to customers and knew that these\nsolutions the consultants had come up with were not what customers wanted.\nYet their performance reviews were based on delivering those products. They\nwanted to do right by the customer, but they couldn\u2019t, for fear of losing their jobs.\nAnd so they built the wrong thing\u2014knowingly. At the end of the year, Company\nB missed all of its goals, and the teams were penalized, even though they deliv-\nered on their roadmaps.\nWhen these teams realized that customers did not want the consultant-\nproposed solution, they should have had the freedom to explore alternative\noptions. That is how a product-led organization would operate. This is what\nkeeps us out of the build trap. Instead, their adherence to predetermined meet-\nings and formalities trapped them into staying quiet. Product teams need the\nfreedom to explore solutions and to adjust their actions according to the data they\nreceive. As long as they are aligned with the overall strategic intents and vision\nfor the company, management should feel comfortable granting the necessary\nautonomy to capable teams.\nInstead of sending down mandates, organizations should, instead, turn to\naligning every level of the company around the why and should give the next\nlayer down the opportunity to figure out the how and report back. When done\nthis way, product management is successful. When leadership is not aligned at\nthe top, the issues trickle all the way down to the teams. The lack of meaning and\nfocus spreads, and, at the end of the year, the company will look at their target\ngoals and ask, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lack of leadership alignment is by far the big-\ngest issue I see standing in the way of successful product management.\nThe Effects Gap\nThe Effects Gap (Figure 11-3) is the difference between what we expect our\nactions to achieve and what actually happens. When organizations do not see the\nresults they want, they try to fill this gap by putting more controls in place. How-\never, that is the worst thing you can do in this scenario. Giving individuals and\nteams the freedom to adjust their actions so that they are in line with their goals\nis what will truly allow them to achieve results.\n68 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP",
        "Source: BuildTrap\nContent: The Alignment Gap\nThe Alignment Gap, shown in Figure 11-2, is the difference between what people\ndo and what management wants them to do, which is to achieve the business\ngoals. Organizations try to fill this gap by providing more detailed instruction;\nwhereas, instead, they should allow each level within the company to define how\nit will achieve the intent of the next level up.\nFigure 11-2. The Alignment Gap, by Stephen Bungay from the Art of Action (reprinted by per-\nmission of Hodder & Stoughton)\nAt one company, I walked around asking all of the product managers on the\nhundred or so teams why they were working on their current project. I then\nasked their leaders the same question. I got two different answers from these two\ndifferent levels. They could not connect the activities of the teams back to the out-\ncomes of the companies because leadership had passed down feature requests\nrather than expected outcomes and goals. As soon as those feature requests were\ncommitted, it was nearly impossible to change them because the company\nexpected them to be delivered.\nAlthough I\u2019ve witnessed this at many companies, there is one example that\nalways haunts me. I was training product managers at a very large and estab-\nlished company (let\u2019s call it Company B), when I was told that it could not do any\nvalidation work around its products because the solutions the teams were build-\ning were already committed to the leadership of the company. Why? Well, Com-\npany B had hired a huge consulting firm to explore and dictate its product\nroadmap for the next five years. The consultants poured over market research\nSTRATEGIC GAPS | 67"
