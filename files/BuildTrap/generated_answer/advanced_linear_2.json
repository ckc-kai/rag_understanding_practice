      "The Build T rap\nThe build trap is when organizations become stuck measuring their suc-\ncess by outputs rather than outcomes. It\u2019s when they focus more on ship-\nping and developing features rather than on the actual value those things\nproduce. When companies stop producing real value for the users, they\nbegin to lose market share, allowing them to be disrupted.

At that point, product manag-\ners can find the opportunities to maximize business and customer value.\n1\nPART | I",

If you want to learn more, head to Black Swan Farming and\nread about how to utilize the concept in your company.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that, after you ship the first version, though, you\nare not technically done. You still need to reach your goals. This is where the\nDefinition of Done comes into play.\nThe Real Definition of Done\nIn Agile development, there is a concept called the Definition of Done. It is\ndefined by the Scrum Alliance as a \u201cchecklist of valuable activities required to\nproduce software.\u201d 1 When teams create their Definition of Done, it\u2019s usually\naround finishing building features required to ship a product. Although this is\ndefinitely a useful concept to make sure the team finished what it needs to, it sets\nthe wrong expectation about what a finished feature is.\nWe are done developing or iterating on a feature only when it has reached its\ngoals. Often, teams ship a first version of the feature and then move on to the\nnext, without measuring the outcomes for the user. As Jeff Gothelf, the author of\nSense & Respond , once said, \u201cVersion 2 is the biggest lie in software develop-\nment.\u201d This mentality always leads to the build trap.\nInstead, teams should be working like the team at Marquetly, by setting the\nsuccess criteria before launch, while measuring and iterating until they reach it.\nVersion 1 should be looked at as a hypothesis, just like any other work. And, if we\nlaunch the feature and it is not hitting our goals, we need to be comfortable roll-\ning it back and trying something else.\nWhen you have success criteria set for the launch, you can use them in the\nProduct Kata and repeat the steps we went through in this section: set the direc-\ntion with your success criteria, understand what problems are standing in the\nway of you reaching it, and systematically tackle them through experimentation.\nNo matter whether you are building a new feature or optimizing one, the\nprocess is the same.",

They\nwanted to do right by the customer, but they couldn\u2019t, for fear of losing their jobs.\nAnd so they built the wrong thing\u2014knowingly. At the end of the year, Company\nB missed all of its goals, and the teams were penalized, even though they deliv-\nered on their roadmaps.\nWhen these teams realized that customers did not want the consultant-\nproposed solution, they should have had the freedom to explore alternative\noptions. That is how a product-led organization would operate. This is what\nkeeps us out of the build trap. Instead, their adherence to predetermined meet-\nings and formalities trapped them into staying quiet. Product teams need the\nfreedom to explore solutions and to adjust their actions according to the data they\nreceive. As long as they are aligned with the overall strategic intents and vision\nfor the company, management should feel comfortable granting the necessary\nautonomy to capable teams.\nInstead of sending down mandates, organizations should, instead, turn to\naligning every level of the company around the why and should give the next\nlayer down the opportunity to figure out the how and report back. When done\nthis way, product management is successful. When leadership is not aligned at\nthe top, the issues trickle all the way down to the teams. The lack of meaning and\nfocus spreads, and, at the end of the year, the company will look at their target\ngoals and ask, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lack of leadership alignment is by far the big-\ngest issue I see standing in the way of successful product management.\nThe Effects Gap\nThe Effects Gap ( Figure 11-3 ) is the difference between what we expect our\nactions to achieve and what actually happens. When organizations do not see the\nresults they want, they try to fill this gap by putting more controls in place. How-\never, that is the worst thing you can do in this scenario.

The second is the **waiter archetype**, where product managers focus on listening to stakeholders without validating solutions or pushing back when better ideas are available. They often implement features based on customer wants rather than addressing underlying customer needs. Finally, the third archetype involves product managers who transition into roles that emphasize timeliness (e.g., project management) but fail to prioritize why a feature is needed.",

Then he made sure to follow up with them, ask their\nopinions, and give credit back to the team. He still had to win their trust back,\nbut he was definitely going in the right direction.\nListening to everyone\u2019s opinions is important, but it doesn\u2019t mean a product\nmanager should implement every suggestion. Swinging too far in that direction\nbrings us to the other most common archetype of the product manager: the\nwaiter.\nThe Waiter\nThe waiter is a product manager who, at heart, is an order taker. They go to their\nstakeholders, customers, or managers, ask for what they want, and turn those\nwants into a list of items to be developed. There is no goal. There is no vision.\nThere is no decision making involved. This was the archetype of 90% of the\nproduct owner teams at Marquetly.\nThe most common question I get from product managers in this position is,\n\u201cHow do I prioritize?\u201d Because they have no goal in which to provide context for\ntrade-offs, it becomes a popularity contest for whomever is making the request.\nMore often than not, the most important person gets their features prioritized.\nThis happens frequently in very large companies. The product managers go out,\nwith all the right intentions, to talk to their customers and learn what they want.\nBut, instead of discovering problems, waiters ask, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d The cus-\ntomer asks for a specific solution, and these product managers implement them.\nThis is where you end up in what my friend David Bland, product advisor and\nconsultant, calls the product death cycle, shown in Figure 6-1.\n28 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP",
      "Figure 6-1. The product death cycle, by David J. Bland (reprinted by permission of David J.\nBland)\nThe product death cycle is a specific form of the build trap. You are imple-\nmenting ideas without validating them. It\u2019s not the customer\u2019s job to come up\nwith their own solutions. That is your job. You need to deeply understand their\nproblems and then determine the best solutions for them.\nWaiters are reactive thinkers, not strategic thinkers. There\u2019s usually an\namount of learned helplessness that contributes to that. They don\u2019t believe that\nthey can push back on these solutions and dive deeper into problems. But that\u2019s\nnot true. Customers want their problems solved. Leaders want to hit goals. Push-\ning back is essential to building a successful product. That\u2019s part of the job.\nIt\u2019s very possible to find the waiter archetype paired with another one, like\nproject management. Because they are not focused on the why, they tend to focus\na lot on the when. Project managers who are put into product management roles\noften become waiters waving a calendar.\nThe Former Project Manager\nProduct managers are not project managers, although a little project manage-\nment is needed to execute on the role correctly. Project managers are responsible\nfor the when. When will a project finish? Is everyone on track? Will we hit our\ndeadline?\nProduct managers are responsible for the why?

      "Bad Product Manager\nArchetypes\nThere are few paths available today to learn product management. It isn\u2019t taught\nat college. Training programs on the job are usually lacking. Microsoft and Goo-\ngle are two of the only major companies that actually have an entry-level career\npath for product managers. Internships are few and far between. And most prod-\nuct managers you meet have made either a lateral move inside their company or\nhave been \u201cpromoted\u201d from software development.\nIf you are lucky enough to be taught product management, what you learn is\nusually very tactile: writing requirements documents (or user stories in Agile),\nplanning meetings with developers, running check-in meetings, gathering\nrequests from the business team, and testing for acceptance of the developed\nwork and bugs. Many of these steps stem from the work of product managers\nwho operate in a traditional Waterfall environment. This is the environment in\nwhich I learned.\nUnder a Waterfall process, the first step for a product manager is to talk to\nthe people in the business\u2014usually called internal stakeholders\u2014and ask them for\ntheir input and requests. This is encouraged in the trainings of newly minted\nproduct managers: always satisfy your stakeholder. In my first role, I was told\nthat the stakeholders were the marketing managers, my boss, and the sales\nteams. I met with them weekly, gained an understanding of what they needed\naccomplished, and then turned those requirements into specs.\nAfter the requirements are detailed out, they are usually handed to the\ndesigners to create an attractive-looking interface, while working with the devel-\nopers to ensure that the systems requirements are there. After the product man-\nagers approve the designers\u2019 work, the software engineers can begin coding.\n25\n| 6",

Instead, they need to rely on influencing them to actually move in\na certain direction.\nOut of this wonderful CEO myth emerged an archetype of a very arrogant\nproduct manager who thinks they rule the world. I found one of these types at\nMarquetly. His name was Nick. Nick had just graduated from business school\nand was hired into the company as a product manager. All of the developers\nhated him. The UX designers, too. Why?\nFrankly, Nick was terrible to the designers and developers. He specifically\nwanted to be a product manager because he fancied himself the next Steve Jobs,\na visionary who would dictate, from on high, to his team everything they should\nbuild.

Remember our four levels of strategy: vision, strategic intent, prod-\nuct initiatives, and options. Each of these is on a different time horizon, and pro-\ngress toward them should be communicated accordingly.\nMost companies I\u2019ve worked with have a few core meetings to evaluate pro-\ngress and to make strategic decisions from a product level:\n\u2022 Quarterly business reviews\n\u2022 Product initiative reviews\n\u2022 Release reviews\nDuring quarterly business review  meetings, the senior leadership team, made\nup of the executives and the highest level of the organization, should be discus-\nsing progress toward the strategic intents and outcomes of a financial nature.\nThis includes reviewing revenue for the quarter, churn of customers, and costs\nassociated with development or operations. The chief product officer (CPO) and\ntheir VPs of product are responsible for communicating how the outcomes of\nproduct initiatives have furthered strategic intents, like Karen did at Marquetly.\nNew strategic intents can be introduced in this meeting, as older ones are com-\ning to completion. It is not a place to prioritize new product initiatives or to go\ninto detail on them. That is what the product initiative review is for.\nThe product initiative review  is another quarterly meeting that can be stag-\ngered with the quarterly business review on off months. This meeting is for the\nproduct development side of the house\u2014CPO, CTO, design leaders, the VPs of\nproduct, and the product managers. Here we review the progress of the options\nagainst the product initiatives and adjust our strategy accordingly. This is the\nplace for product managers to talk about the results of preliminary experimenta-\ntion, research, or first releases, as they relate to overall goals. New product initia-\ntives can be introduced in this meeting for feedback and buy-in, along with\nfunding from the product development leadership group. Product teams can ask\nfor more funding to build a first version or to optimize an existing solution.\nRelease reviews provide the opportunity for teams to show off the hard work\nthey have done and to talk about success metrics. These should happen monthly,\nbefore features go out, to showcase what is in the pipeline to be released.",
      "Strategy Deployment\nStrategies are interconnecting stories told throughout the organization that\nexplain the objective and outcomes, tailored to a specific time frame. We call this\nact of communicating and aligning those narratives strategy deployment.\nJabe Bloom, the founder of consulting firm PraxisFlow, works with execu-\ntives to create and deploy strategies at large organizations. He explains why we\nshould think about different levels of strategies as stories at different time scales:\nAt different levels of organizations, we tell stories with different scales of\ntime (timespans), about our work and why we are doing it. In order for\npeople to act on the stories they hear, the stories can\u2019t have significantly\ndifferent time scales than they are accustomed to. Agile teams are really\ngood at telling two- to four-week stories. That\u2019s what they deal with on a\ndaily basis. As you go up in the organization, you tell stories with longer\ntimespans. Executives are really good at telling five-year stories, but a\nteam cannot act on a five-year story when they\u2019re used to thinking in two\nto four weeks. There\u2019s too much space to explore.\nStrategy deployment is about setting the right level of goals and objectives\nthroughout the organization to narrow the playing field so that teams can act. So,\nwhile executives might be looking at a five-year strategy, middle management is\nthinking in smaller strategies\u2014yearly or quarterly\u2014bounding the teams in a\ndirection that allows them to make decisions on a monthly or weekly basis.\nWhen teams are not sufficiently constrained, they become stuck. As Bloom\nexplains:\nThe unconstrained team is the most frightened and scared to act in the\norganization. They feel like they cannot make a decision because there are\ntoo many options. Appropriately constrained teams, ones who have a\ndirection set to the right level for them, feel safe to make decisions\nbecause they can see how their stories align to the goals and structure of\nthe organization.\nNot having the right level of direction lands us in the build trap. Teams are\ngiven instructions that are either too prescriptive or too broad. Executives will get\ntoo far into the weeds, managing by authority and not allowing autonomy.

      "The first task is to get to the product initiative. To do this, you need to under-\nstand the strategic intent, evaluate the current state of that strategic intent in rela-\ntion to where your products can help, and determine what problems you can\nsolve to further that strategic intent. This is what Marquetly did during its\nresearch and analysis to arrive at the product initiatives of increasing content and\nbuilding out a more robust assessment.\nThere can be many options that help reach the product initiative, as we saw\nwith the three we had to produce more content at Marquetly. One or all of these\nmight be what it takes to get us to the successful outcome of the initiative, and\nthat\u2019s okay. To determine whether we are getting closer to achieving our product\ninitiative, we need to break the success metrics into something we can measure\non a shorter time scale. We call this the team goal, and it\u2019s how we measure the\nsuccess of the option. Although it can take six months or longer to reach the\nproduct initiative goal, the team goal should be something we can measure after\nevery release, which gives us feedback that our option is working the way we\nwant it to. We set the team goal with the same process as we did for the product\ninitiative.\nContext Matters\nSince Lean Startup emerged on the scene, experimentation has been a hot button\ntopic in many software companies. I see teams readily jump into experimenting,\nexciting to kick off that A/B test or to prototype something. It\u2019s important to take\na step back and understand where you are and what is needed in that stage\nbefore you jump into any work. This is where the Product Kata helps.\nAfter we have set the goal, we begin walking through the Product Kata. We\nask ourselves the following:\n1. What is the goal?\n2. Where are we now in relation to that goal?\n3. What is the biggest problem or obstacle standing in the way of me reach-\ning that goal?\n4. How do I try to solve that problem?\n5.

It takes a lot of effort to line up\nthe interviews, and sometimes that can seem more daunting than staying inside\nand jumping right into A/B testing or sifting through data. Although data analy-\nsis is important, it can\u2019t tell the entire story. So it\u2019s essential that we all get and go\ntalk to actual humans to get to the heart of their problems. In fact, Giff Constable\nwrote an entire book, called Talking to Humans, that can walk you through how to\ndo just that.\nUser research, observations, surveys, and customer feedback are all tools that\nyou can harness to better explore the problem from a user standpoint. User\nresearch, in this case, is not to be mistaken for usability testing , which involves\nshowing a prototype or website and directing people to complete actions. There,\nyou are learning whether they can use and navigate the solution easily, not\nwhether the solution actually solves a problem. This type of research is called\nevaluative.\nProblem-based user research is generative research, meaning that its purpose\nis to find the problem you want to solve. It involves going to the source of the\ncustomer\u2019s problem and understanding the context around it. This is what Mar-\nquetly did. The team went to the customers, conducted observations, and then\nasked questions. \u201cWhat is the biggest problem standing in the way of you finish-\ning your course? What\u2019s the pain?\u201d When conducting problem-based research,\nyou are trying to identify the pain point and the root cause of the problem. When\nyou understand the context around a customer\u2019s problem, you can form a better\nsolution to solve it. Without that, you are just guessing.\nIt\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of solving problems before you find their root\ncauses.",
      "Karen went over to Christa, the product manager on the teacher experience,\nto give her the news and set her up to explore the issues with her team.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to walk through the Product Kata in order to set you up for suc-\ncess. So, first, you need to identify your obstacles or customer problems standing\nin the way of teachers creating more content. Let\u2019s regroup in a week and see\nwhat you\u2019ve found around that.\u201d\nChrista enlisted the help of their UX designer and lead engineer to dive\ndeeper. She started off by going over their product initiative and helping them\nunderstand how they got there. Then she explained what they already knew:\n\u201cWhen we did the initial research, we found that a lot of the students were\ninterested in learning new marketing methods. These were things like harness-\ning social media and content creation to drive traffic to the site. So it\u2019s not\nenough just to increase content\u2014we have to be strategic about it. We\u2019ve been get-\nting feedback for months from teachers emailing us for help. A lot of the ques-\ntions are around how to upload information more quickly, and there seems to be\na very clumsy workflow. I\u2019m trying to figure out how widespread the issue is so\nwe can quantify it. What can we do to get data on how many people experience\nthis problem?\u201d\n\u201cI can set up a quick open-ended survey with a text box for our teachers and\nask what is preventing them from doing a second course,\u201d said the UX designer,\nMatt.\n\u201cI can pull session times out of the system from when people start a course\nand when they complete it. We have event timing around this,\u201d Rich, the lead\ndeveloper said.\n\u201cGreat! Let\u2019s take a week and investigate as much as we can. At the end, we\ncan pull together the data and see if this is something worth diving deeper into.\u201d\nThe team got to work. Early the next week, everyone got back together to go\nover the findings. I met up with them to go through their results.\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d Matt said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how poorly the experience was\ndesigned, and the teachers sound incredibly frustrated. It takes them on average,\na month to put together a course, even when they have most of the content\nalready developed.",
      "Solution Exploration\nI met with the team again two weeks later to review what it learned.\n\u201cWe found a bigger problem standing in the way of reaching our goal,\u201d said\nChrista, grinning. \u201cOur teachers are spending upward of 80 hours over two\nmonths editing videos for their class. There are some people who are even\nreshooting the videos over and over again so they don\u2019t have to edit.\u201d\nI was very proud of them. \u201cSee, trying to solve one problem uncovered a big-\nger one. What is the next step?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019re running an experiment to see whether taking on video editing for a\nselect group of our teachers will result in more courses being published from\nthat group,\u201d said Christa. The team began to walk through the Kata to determine\nwhat it needed to learn next.\n\u201cWe know that video editing is a problem for most of our teachers, but we\nneed to learn whether solving this problem will increase the published rate of\ncourses,\u201d said Rich.\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d I said. \u201cNow how do you make that happen?\u201d\nThe team scoped out its experiment. They would pitch the video-editing ser-\nvice to the teachers and help up to 10 of them per week for two weeks. There\nwere two video editors at Marquetly working in its marketing department.\nChrista asked Karen to get buy-in from the VP of marketing to have them help\nexecute on the experiment for two weeks, and he agreed. Together, they deter-\nmined that they could handle about seven courses per week together, in that\namount of time.\nWith that in mind, and already knowing the potential revenue each pub-\nlished course could bring in, Christa set their success metric to be at least 10 of\nthe courses they worked on to be published within a month.\nTwo weeks after launching the experiment, I came back to check on the team\nand see what it learned.\n119\n| 18"
    ],
    "ground_truth": "Actual Root Cause: The team discovered that video editing was the biggest pain point. Teachers were spending upward of 80 hours over two months editing videos, or reshooting them to avoid editing, because they were marketing experts, not video experts. Validation: They ran a Concierge Experiment. The team pitched a video-editing service to teachers and manually edited videos for them for two weeks. This resulted in a publish rate increase from 25% to 75%, validating that solving the video editing problem would achieve their business goals."

      "Strategic Gaps\nWhile studying strategy in many organizations, Stephen Bungay discovered that,\nwhen companies approach strategy as a plan, they often fail to achieve what they\nexpected. This failure stems from the actions taken to fill the following gaps that\nexist between outcomes, plans, and actions. These gaps ultimately cause friction\nwithin the organization:\n\u2022 The Knowledge Gap\n\u2022 The Alignment Gap\n\u2022 The Effects Gap\nThe Knowledge Gap\nThe Knowledge Gap ( Figure 11-1) is the difference between what management\nwould like to know and what the company actually knows.

      "The Alignment Gap\nThe Alignment Gap, shown in Figure 11-2, is the difference between what people\ndo and what management wants them to do, which is to achieve the business\ngoals. Organizations try to fill this gap by providing more detailed instruction;\nwhereas, instead, they should allow each level within the company to define how\nit will achieve the intent of the next level up.\nFigure 11-2. The Alignment Gap, by Stephen Bungay from the Art of Action (reprinted by per-\nmission of Hodder & Stoughton)\nAt one company, I walked around asking all of the product managers on the\nhundred or so teams why they were working on their current project. I then\nasked their leaders the same question. I got two different answers from these two\ndifferent levels. They could not connect the activities of the teams back to the out-\ncomes of the companies because leadership had passed down feature requests\nrather than expected outcomes and goals. As soon as those feature requests were\ncommitted, it was nearly impossible to change them because the company\nexpected them to be delivered.\nAlthough I\u2019ve witnessed this at many companies, there is one example that\nalways haunts me. I was training product managers at a very large and estab-\nlished company (let\u2019s call it Company B), when I was told that it could not do any\nvalidation work around its products because the solutions the teams were build-\ning were already committed to the leadership of the company. Why? Well, Com-\npany B had hired a huge consulting firm to explore and dictate its product\nroadmap for the next five years. The consultants poured over market research\nSTRATEGIC GAPS | 67",
      "Figure 11-3. The Effects Gap, by Stephen Bungay from the Art of Action (reprinted by permission\nof Hodder & Stoughton)\nAll of these misguided, knee-jerk reactions start to pile up. Instead of align-\ning a team with a framework of goals and direction and then stepping back to\ngive that team the room to explore how to reach the goals, management usually\nswings a complete 180 degrees. It asks for more information. It expects teams to\ncommit to what management wants to do over the next year. It prescribes fully\nthought-out solutions, and then product teams are restricted to only those param-\neters instead of being able to focus on learning and adjusting their decisions as\nthey go.\nTo solve these various gaps and to deliver great products to your customers,\nyou need to view strategy in a different way, and, as Bungay proposes, enable\naction to achieve results. But why do we care about strategy being something that\nenables action? Well, that is how you scale an organization\u2014by enabling action\nthrough autonomous teams.\nAutonomous T eams\nAt Marquetly, the product managers were very frustrated by their lack of\nautonomy. One experienced product manager told me, \u201cI keep having leaders tell\nme to own the vision of my product, but I\u2019m not allowed. My manager keeps\nhanding me solutions. Every time I try to suggest something different, I\u2019m shut\ndown. When we went Agile, we were told that our Scrum teams were supposed\nto be autonomous. This is definitely not autonomy.\u201d\nSTRATEGIC GAPS | 69",
      "In every organization where I\u2019ve seen leaders operate this\nway, the story is not complete. Typically, there\u2019s a lack of alignment, and the\ngoals of the team do not line up to an overall vision and strategy of the company.\nThis Alignment Gap is what truly causes the demand for more and more infor-\nmation.\n66 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP",
      "and competitive analyses and came up with a roadmap, which then trickled down\nto the teams.\nThese teams, meanwhile, had been talking to customers and knew that these\nsolutions the consultants had come up with were not what customers wanted.\nYet their performance reviews were based on delivering those products. They\nwanted to do right by the customer, but they couldn\u2019t, for fear of losing their jobs.\nAnd so they built the wrong thing\u2014knowingly. At the end of the year, Company\nB missed all of its goals, and the teams were penalized, even though they deliv-\nered on their roadmaps.\nWhen these teams realized that customers did not want the consultant-\nproposed solution, they should have had the freedom to explore alternative\noptions. That is how a product-led organization would operate. This is what\nkeeps us out of the build trap. Instead, their adherence to predetermined meet-\nings and formalities trapped them into staying quiet. Product teams need the\nfreedom to explore solutions and to adjust their actions according to the data they\nreceive. As long as they are aligned with the overall strategic intents and vision\nfor the company, management should feel comfortable granting the necessary\nautonomy to capable teams.\nInstead of sending down mandates, organizations should, instead, turn to\naligning every level of the company around the why and should give the next\nlayer down the opportunity to figure out the how and report back. When done\nthis way, product management is successful. When leadership is not aligned at\nthe top, the issues trickle all the way down to the teams. The lack of meaning and\nfocus spreads, and, at the end of the year, the company will look at their target\ngoals and ask, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lack of leadership alignment is by far the big-\ngest issue I see standing in the way of successful product management.\nThe Effects Gap\nThe Effects Gap ( Figure 11-3 ) is the difference between what we expect our\nactions to achieve and what actually happens. When organizations do not see the\nresults they want, they try to fill this gap by putting more controls in place. How-\never, that is the worst thing you can do in this scenario.

    "question": "According to the text, what is the definition of the 'Build Trap'?",
    "response": "The Build Trap is a situation where companies prioritize building software or features over delivering real value to customers. This focus leads them to neglect customer needs and market demands, resulting in ineffective innovation, reduced market share, and potential disruption from competitors. Companies trapped here struggle to see the importance of outcomes beyond outputs, leading to failure to adapt and evolve. To escape, they must adopt product-led practices that prioritize maximizing value for both customers and stakeholders.\n\nAnswer: The Build Trap is when companies focus on building products without prioritizing delivering real value to customers, leading to ineffective innovation and market disruption. Companies can exit this trap by adopting product-led strategies focused on creating and sustaining value continuously.",
    "contexts": [
      "The Build Trap\nThe build trap is when organizations become stuck measuring their suc-\ncess by outputs rather than outcomes. It\u2019s when they focus more on ship-\nping and developing features rather than on the actual value those things\nproduce. When companies stop producing real value for the users, they\nbegin to lose market share, allowing them to be disrupted. Companies can\nget out of the build trap by setting themselves up to develop intentional\nand robust product management practices. At that point, product manag-\ners can find the opportunities to maximize business and customer value.\n1\nPART | I\n\n\u201cChris, your problem isn\u2019t just your product managers,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re defi-\nnitely green, and you\u2019re going to have to hire some more senior people, but you\nhave process, strategy, and organizational issues, as well, that are preventing you\nfrom hitting your goals.\u201d\nThe CEO of Marquetly, Chris, had called me to talk frankly about the state of\nMarquetly, an education company that provides online training for marketers.\nExperts in digital marketing, Marquetly professionals create classes through their\nonline platform that any individual can take for a monthly subscription.\nSix months earlier, Chris had hired me to train and coach the company\u2019s\nproduct managers. Marquetly was growing rapidly, with revenue growth year-\nover-year holding steady around 30%. The company hired hundreds of people in\na very short amount of time, assigning them to all sorts of projects. Many of\nthose people were developers, and they soon learned they needed product manag-\ners to work with them, after adopting an Agile framework called Scrum.\nThey moved marketing people, individuals with no prior experience in prod-\nuct management, into that role to work with the developers because they knew\nthe audience for the school best. Marquetly\u2019s story was similar to those of other\ncompanies I had advised, and I knew that the issues were probably deeper than\njust skill based.\nWhen I came into the company, I met with its VP of product, Karen. She had\nbeen hired three months earlier to oversee the dozens of new product managers.\n\u201cI am under a ridiculous amount of pressure,\u201d Karen told me. \u201cThe sales\nteam has promised all of these features to enterprise clients.

The prob-\nlem wasn\u2019t that it did not have a great idea or a great product but that the com-\npany itself was not set up to keep growing that product to succeed. The\nTHE BUILD TRAP | 5\n\norganization was missing the roles, strategy, process, and policies needed to\nreally promote and sustain real value creation.\nThe build trap is a terrifying place for companies because it distracts them.\nEveryone is so focused on shipping more software that they lose sight of what is\nimportant: producing value for customers, hitting business goals, and innovating\nagainst competitors.\nWhen we lose sight of what is important, when we forget what value means,\nthe products we produce\u2014and sometimes our companies themselves\u2014fail. This\nhas happened to organizations large and small.\nKodak failed to see digital photography disrupting it. Instead of responding\nto the change, it doubled down on how it always did things. When the company\ntried to innovate (which I talk about at the end of this book), it was not set up\nstructurally to do so. It was too little, too late.\nMicrosoft, although not in danger of failing immediately, was on the path to\ndisruption. It had been using the same strategic recipe over and over again,\ncounting on Windows to carry its business, until CEO Satya Nadella came in. He\nrealigned the company to a future strategy that would see it continue innovating\nand then adjusted the people working on those activities accordingly.\nThe build trap isn\u2019t just about shipping software. It\u2019s about realizing you\nhave to change the way you\u2019ve always done things. It\u2019s about confusing output-\ncentric measures of progress with real measures of value.",

      "The more you try to hide your progress,\nthe wider that knowledge gap becomes. Leaders will demand more information\nand will crack down on your freedom to explore.

When leaders do not see progress toward goals, they quickly resort to\ntheir old ways.\nWe need a cadence of communicating strategy that matches our strategic\nframework. Remember our four levels of strategy: vision, strategic intent, prod-\nuct initiatives, and options. Each of these is on a different time horizon, and pro-\ngress toward them should be communicated accordingly.\nMost companies I\u2019ve worked with have a few core meetings to evaluate pro-\ngress and to make strategic decisions from a product level:\n\u2022 Quarterly business reviews\n\u2022 Product initiative reviews\n\u2022 Release reviews\nDuring quarterly business review meetings, the senior leadership team, made\nup of the executives and the highest level of the organization, should be discus-\nsing progress toward the strategic intents and outcomes of a financial nature.\nThis includes reviewing revenue for the quarter, churn of customers, and costs\nassociated with development or operations. The chief product officer (CPO) and\ntheir VPs of product are responsible for communicating how the outcomes of\nproduct initiatives have furthered strategic intents, like Karen did at Marquetly.\nNew strategic intents can be introduced in this meeting, as older ones are com-\ning to completion. It is not a place to prioritize new product initiatives or to go\ninto detail on them. That is what the product initiative review is for.\nThe product initiative review is another quarterly meeting that can be stag-\ngered with the quarterly business review on off months. This meeting is for the\nproduct development side of the house\u2014CPO, CTO, design leaders, the VPs of\nproduct, and the product managers. Here we review the progress of the options\nagainst the product initiatives and adjust our strategy accordingly. This is the\nplace for product managers to talk about the results of preliminary experimenta-\ntion, research, or first releases, as they relate to overall goals.

Before that, I was building things that\ndid not produce the desired results for my customers, and no one adopted them.\nI also had an unmotivated team that was slow to deliver because they were not\nbought in.\u201d\nNick sat there and took it in. \u201cI want to do well at this. Tell me what I have to\ndo to get better and build cool products.\u201d\n\u201cStart listening to your team. Involve them.

They go to their\nstakeholders, customers, or managers, ask for what they want, and turn those\nwants into a list of items to be developed. There is no goal. There is no vision.\nThere is no decision making involved. This was the archetype of 90% of the\nproduct owner teams at Marquetly.\nThe most common question I get from product managers in this position is,\n\u201cHow do I prioritize?\u201d Because they have no goal in which to provide context for\ntrade-offs, it becomes a popularity contest for whomever is making the request.\nMore often than not, the most important person gets their features prioritized.",

The product death cycle, by David J. Bland (reprinted by permission of David J.\nBland)\nThe product death cycle is a specific form of the build trap. You are imple-\nmenting ideas without validating them. It\u2019s not the customer\u2019s job to come up\nwith their own solutions. That is your job. You need to deeply understand their\nproblems and then determine the best solutions for them.\nWaiters are reactive thinkers, not strategic thinkers. There\u2019s usually an\namount of learned helplessness that contributes to that. They don\u2019t believe that\nthey can push back on these solutions and dive deeper into problems. But that\u2019s\nnot true. Customers want their problems solved. Leaders want to hit goals. Push-\ning back is essential to building a successful product. That\u2019s part of the job.\nIt\u2019s very possible to find the waiter archetype paired with another one, like\nproject management. Because they are not focused on the why, they tend to focus\na lot on the when. Project managers who are put into product management roles\noften become waiters waving a calendar.\nThe Former Project Manager\nProduct managers are not project managers, although a little project manage-\nment is needed to execute on the role correctly. Project managers are responsible\nfor the when. When will a project finish? Is everyone on track? Will we hit our\ndeadline?\nProduct managers are responsible for the why? Why are we building this?\nHow does it deliver value to our customers? How does it help meet the goals of\nBAD PRODUCT MANAGER ARCHETYPES | 29\n\nthe business?",
      "CEOs have sole authority over many things. They can fire people. They can\nchange up teams. They can change directions. Product managers, on the other\n26 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\nhand, can\u2019t change many of the things a CEO can in an organization. They espe-\ncially don\u2019t have authority over people, because they are not people managers at\nthe team level. Instead, they need to rely on influencing them to actually move in\na certain direction.\nOut of this wonderful CEO myth emerged an archetype of a very arrogant\nproduct manager who thinks they rule the world. I found one of these types at\nMarquetly. His name was Nick. Nick had just graduated from business school\nand was hired into the company as a product manager. All of the developers\nhated him. The UX designers, too. Why?\nFrankly, Nick was terrible to the designers and developers. He specifically\nwanted to be a product manager because he fancied himself the next Steve Jobs,\na visionary who would dictate, from on high, to his team everything they should\nbuild. Needless to say, the rest of his team didn\u2019t like that very much. He was\nfrustrated. \u201cThe team won\u2019t listen to me. I can\u2019t get them to build what I want.\u201d\nPoor Nick. He just didn\u2019t understand his role.\nI took him aside and said, \u201cLook, I was once just like you, and let me tell you,\nthis mindset does not work out in your favor. I came into OpenSky, our celebrity\ne-commerce site, grabbed on to that manager title, and didn\u2019t want to let go. I\nnever wanted to hear criticism about my own ideas. After all, I was the visionary.\nThis was my JOB. If anyone came to me with another idea, I dismissed it imme-\ndiately. That attitude does not win you friends. And, honestly, I was miserable.\nMy team didn\u2019t want to work with me.\u201d\nI had his attention. I kept going. \u201cSo, one day, my boss took me aside and\ntold me that if I didn\u2019t start winning over the team, I was going to fail. That\u2019s\nwhen I changed my approach. He reminded me that my job was to produce\nvalue, not develop my own ideas.",
      "With the increased prominence of Agile\nmethodologies, more and more people are seeing the flaws of a system that takes\nyears to determine whether the given requirements are even the correct ones.\nMany companies, such as our friends at Marquetly, have eagerly adopted\nAgile, thinking it was a silver bullet for creating more value in software, only to\nbe disappointed. Why? Agile does indeed promote a better way of collaboration\nand a faster method of building software, but it largely ignores how to do effec-\ntive product management.\nAgile assumed that someone was doing that front-of-funnel part, generating\nand validating ideas, and instead optimized the production of software. Yet, that\npiece has been lost along the way, as companies believe that Agile is all you need\nto do successful software development. So, many product managers in Agile\norganizations still operate with this Waterfall mindset.\nBeing a great product manager takes a thorough understanding of your\nusers, a careful analysis of your systems, and an ability to see and execute on\nopportunities for your market. When you go through the motions without active\nthinking, you end up with a lot of useless features. We rarely teach product man-\nagers how to think, and, even if we do, we don\u2019t measure this thinking for suc-\ncess. Instead, we are praised for writing detailed specifications or for making\nsure the developers are shipping on time.\nWhen I ask people how they would define a product manager, I get lots of\ndifferent answers\u2014even from product managers themselves. \u201cProduct managers\nare the ones who come up with the ideas for what to build!\u201d Or, \u201cThey are the\nvoice of the customer!\u201d And always, \u201cA product manager is the CEO of the prod-\nuct!\u201d\nTo understand what the product manager\u2019s role is not, you need to under-\nstand the common archetypes of bad product managers. Let\u2019s begin with that last\none, given that I particularly hate it.\nThe Mini-CEO\nProduct managers are not the mini-CEOs of a product, yet 90% of the job post-\nings I have seen for product managers describe them as being the mini-CEO.\nCEOs have sole authority over many things. They can fire people. They can\nchange up teams. They can change directions.",
      "Bad Product Manager\nArchetypes\nThere are few paths available today to learn product management. It isn\u2019t taught\nat college. Training programs on the job are usually lacking. Microsoft and Goo-\ngle are two of the only major companies that actually have an entry-level career\npath for product managers. Internships are few and far between. And most prod-\nuct managers you meet have made either a lateral move inside their company or\nhave been \u201cpromoted\u201d from software development.\nIf you are lucky enough to be taught product management, what you learn is\nusually very tactile: writing requirements documents (or user stories in Agile),\nplanning meetings with developers, running check-in meetings, gathering\nrequests from the business team, and testing for acceptance of the developed\nwork and bugs. Many of these steps stem from the work of product managers\nwho operate in a traditional Waterfall environment. This is the environment in\nwhich I learned.\nUnder a Waterfall process, the first step for a product manager is to talk to\nthe people in the business\u2014usually called internal stakeholders\u2014and ask them for\ntheir input and requests. This is encouraged in the trainings of newly minted\nproduct managers: always satisfy your stakeholder. In my first role, I was told\nthat the stakeholders were the marketing managers, my boss, and the sales\nteams. I met with them weekly, gained an understanding of what they needed\naccomplished, and then turned those requirements into specs.\nAfter the requirements are detailed out, they are usually handed to the\ndesigners to create an attractive-looking interface, while working with the devel-\nopers to ensure that the systems requirements are there. After the product man-\nagers approve the designers\u2019 work, the software engineers can begin coding.\n25\n| 6\n\nCoding typically takes months, and, for large projects, it can even take years.\nOnly at the very end of the process does the customer get to see the product.\nNow, if you\u2019re sitting here wringing your hands, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not how it\nshould be done!\u201d I\u2019d agree with you. With the increased prominence of Agile\nmethodologies, more and more people are seeing the flaws of a system that takes\nyears to determine whether the given requirements are even the correct ones."

    "ground_truth": "The three archetypes are: 1.The Mini-CEO; 2.The Waiter; 3.The Former Project Manager. The Waiter is a product manager who is, at heart, an order taker. They go to stakeholders, customers, or managers, ask for what they want, and turn those wants into a list of items to be developed. They have no goal, no vision, and no decision-making involvement; they often struggle to prioritize because it becomes a popularity contest."

    "question": "What are the four levels of 'Strategy Deployment' described in the text, and who is responsible for the 'Strategic Intent' level?",
    "response": "The four levels of Strategy Deployment described in the text are:\n\n1. **Vision** - Typically at the top level, focusing on long-term goals over several years.\n2. **Strategic Intent** - Focuses on medium-term objectives aligned with broader vision.\n3. **Product Initiatives** - More tactical, handled by product teams on a weekly or monthly basis.\n4. **Options** - Shorter-term actions to achieve strategic intents.\n\nMiddle management is responsible for aligning Product Initiatives and options towards Strategic Intent at their time horizon (yearly or quarterly).",

      "There\u2019s too much space to explore.\nStrategy deployment is about setting the right level of goals and objectives\nthroughout the organization to narrow the playing field so that teams can act. So,\nwhile executives might be looking at a five-year strategy, middle management is\nthinking in smaller strategies\u2014yearly or quarterly\u2014bounding the teams in a\ndirection that allows them to make decisions on a monthly or weekly basis.\nWhen teams are not sufficiently constrained, they become stuck. As Bloom\nexplains:\nThe unconstrained team is the most frightened and scared to act in the\norganization. They feel like they cannot make a decision because there are\ntoo many options. Appropriately constrained teams, ones who have a\ndirection set to the right level for them, feel safe to make decisions\nbecause they can see how their stories align to the goals and structure of\nthe organization.\nNot having the right level of direction lands us in the build trap. Teams are\ngiven instructions that are either too prescriptive or too broad. Executives will get\ntoo far into the weeds, managing by authority and not allowing autonomy. Or\nteams could, as Bloom mentioned, be given so much freedom they are unable to\n74 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\nact. That is why strategy deployment is key, from a product development perspec-\ntive.\nThere are many examples of strategy deployment across organizations. \nOKRs is a type of strategy deployment used by Google. Hoshin Kanri is a strategy\ndeployment method used by Toyota. Even the military uses strategy deployment\nwith mission command. All of these are based on the same premise\u2014setting the\ndirection for each level of an organization so they can act. Choosing the right\nframework is important for the organization, but understanding what makes a\ngood strategy framework is even more important.\nIn most product organizations, there should be four major levels in strategy\ndeployment (see Figure 12-1):\n\u2022 Vision\n\u2022 Strategic intent\n\u2022 Product initiatives\n\u2022 Options\nFigure 12-1. Strategy deployment levels\nThe first two are at the company level, whereas the last two are specific to the\nproducts or services of the company. Strategy deployment and strategy creation,\nthough, are two different things. A significant amount of work goes into defining\nwhat each of these should be, coordinating them across product lines and teams\nand then communicating them upward and downward for buy in.",
      "The more you try to hide your progress,\nthe wider that knowledge gap becomes. Leaders will demand more information\nand will crack down on your freedom to explore. If you keep things transparent,\nyou will have more freedom to become autonomous.\nMany companies fall back into bad habits because they have not figured out\nhow to consistently communicate progress across the company in the form of\n148 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\noutcomes. When leaders do not see progress toward goals, they quickly resort to\ntheir old ways.\nWe need a cadence of communicating strategy that matches our strategic\nframework. Remember our four levels of strategy: vision, strategic intent, prod-\nuct initiatives, and options. Each of these is on a different time horizon, and pro-\ngress toward them should be communicated accordingly.\nMost companies I\u2019ve worked with have a few core meetings to evaluate pro-\ngress and to make strategic decisions from a product level:\n\u2022 Quarterly business reviews\n\u2022 Product initiative reviews\n\u2022 Release reviews\nDuring quarterly business review meetings, the senior leadership team, made\nup of the executives and the highest level of the organization, should be discus-\nsing progress toward the strategic intents and outcomes of a financial nature.\nThis includes reviewing revenue for the quarter, churn of customers, and costs\nassociated with development or operations. The chief product officer (CPO) and\ntheir VPs of product are responsible for communicating how the outcomes of\nproduct initiatives have furthered strategic intents, like Karen did at Marquetly.\nNew strategic intents can be introduced in this meeting, as older ones are com-\ning to completion. It is not a place to prioritize new product initiatives or to go\ninto detail on them. That is what the product initiative review is for.\nThe product initiative review is another quarterly meeting that can be stag-\ngered with the quarterly business review on off months. This meeting is for the\nproduct development side of the house\u2014CPO, CTO, design leaders, the VPs of\nproduct, and the product managers. Here we review the progress of the options\nagainst the product initiatives and adjust our strategy accordingly. This is the\nplace for product managers to talk about the results of preliminary experimenta-\ntion, research, or first releases, as they relate to overall goals. New product initia-\ntives can be introduced in this meeting for feedback and buy-in, along with\nfunding from the product development leadership group.",
      "Spotify maintains innovation by not establishing mandates about what to\nbuild from a higher-up perspective. Managers give employees the leeway to par-\nticipate in hackathons and to implement their ideas. They set up an environment\nin which it\u2019s safe to try new things and fail. Upper management is willing to\nembrace uncertainty about what customers want, and, by doing so, they create a\nwork environment that embraces experimentation and innovation and that can\ncourse-correct quickly, when necessary.\nWhen strategy is communicated well in an organization, product develop-\nment and management are synchronized. The company strategy informs the\nactivities of the product development teams, and the execution of work on the\nproducts and data this produces informs the company direction. This should be a\ncyclical process throughout the organization, in which information is being com-\nmunicated up, down, and across, to ensure alignment and understanding.\nCREATING A GOOD STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK | 73\n\nStrategy Deployment\nStrategies are interconnecting stories told throughout the organization that\nexplain the objective and outcomes, tailored to a specific time frame. We call this\nact of communicating and aligning those narratives strategy deployment.\nJabe Bloom, the founder of consulting firm PraxisFlow, works with execu-\ntives to create and deploy strategies at large organizations. He explains why we\nshould think about different levels of strategies as stories at different time scales:\nAt different levels of organizations, we tell stories with different scales of\ntime (timespans), about our work and why we are doing it. In order for\npeople to act on the stories they hear, the stories can\u2019t have significantly\ndifferent time scales than they are accustomed to. Agile teams are really\ngood at telling two- to four-week stories. That\u2019s what they deal with on a\ndaily basis. As you go up in the organization, you tell stories with longer\ntimespans. Executives are really good at telling five-year stories, but a\nteam cannot act on a five-year story when they\u2019re used to thinking in two\nto four weeks. There\u2019s too much space to explore.\nStrategy deployment is about setting the right level of goals and objectives\nthroughout the organization to narrow the playing field so that teams can act.",

A significant amount of work goes into defining\nwhat each of these should be, coordinating them across product lines and teams\nand then communicating them upward and downward for buy in.\nCREATING A GOOD STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK | 75\n\nStrategy Creation\nStrategy creation is the process of figuring out which direction the company\nshould act upon and of developing the framework in which people make deci-\nsions. Strategies are created at each level and then deployed across the organiza-\ntion.\nIf you do not already have a strategy in place, I want to stress that this is not a\none-day or one-week process. I have seen companies try to cram the creation of a\nstrategy into that time frame and fail. This is something that takes time and\nfocus to craft and maintain. You need to be identifying problems and determin-\ning how to organize around solving them at every level of strategy. If you are in\nthe C-Suite, getting this right should be your top priority\u2014or you\u2019ll be setting up\nyour hundreds or thousands of employees for failure.\nStrategy is about how you take the organization from where you currently are\nand reach the vision. For strategy to be created, you must first understand the\nvision, or where you want to go. Then we can identify problems or obstacles\nstanding in our way of getting there and experiment around tackling them. We\nrepeatedly do this until we reach the vision.\nThis is the basis of the continuous improvement framework practiced at \nToyota, called the Improvement Kata, which helped it determine its strategies.\nThe Kata teaches people in the company how to strategically tackle problems to\nreach goals. Mike Rother documented how the process works in his book, Toyota\nKata, an excerpt of which you can see in Figure 12-2.\nFigure 12-2. \u201cThe Four Steps to the Improvement Kata\u201d from Toyota Kata Practice Guide, by\nMike Rother (reprinted by permission of Mike Rother)\n76 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\nDuring the Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycles \u2014in step 4, teams go through\nand systematically identify obstacles standing in the way of reaching the target\ncondition, their next goal, plan out how to tackle it, and then experiment in order\nto see whether the plan worked.",

At the end, we\ncan pull together the data and see if this is something worth diving deeper into.\u201d\nThe team got to work. Early the next week, everyone got back together to go\nover the findings. I met up with them to go through their results.\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d Matt said.",
      "Building and\nOptimizing Your\nSolution\n\u201cAs you know, one of our strategic intents is to double revenue growth from our\nindividual users in two years,\u201d Karen was saying to the leadership team at Mar-\nquetly. \u201cWe believe that by increasing the amount of content on our site in key\nareas of interest, we can double acquisition and increase our retention of existing\nusers to 70%, resulting in a potential revenue increase of $8 million a year from\nindividual users. Christa\u2019s team found a big issue in getting more content on our\nsite. Only 25% of teachers who started a course actually published one to our site,\nand only 10% of our teachers publish a second course.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT?! That is insane. I had no idea those were the numbers. That\u2019s terri-\nble,\u201d Chris, the CEO, exclaimed.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s pretty dismal,\u201d Karen agreed. \u201cThe major cause is video editing.\nOur teachers are experts in marketing\u2014not in video editing. They are spending\nupward of 80 hours trying to just edit videos. We ran two small experiments over\nthe last month to help solve this problem, and we were able to increase the pub-\nlish rate from 25% to 75%, by providing our teachers with simple-to-use video-\nediting software. We\u2019re also seeing preliminary trends that say these new courses\nare reengaging previously checked-out students.\u201d\n\u201cThis is incredibly promising. What do we have to do to make this happen\nfor everyone? Can we just implement what you did for the experiment across all\nteachers?\u201d asked the CTO.\n\u201cFrom a monetary standpoint, we can\u2019t afford to provide licenses to all of our\nteachers. The ROI is not there. Also, if we were to build the functionality our-\nselves, it would take us over a year to launch the first version. The software we\n133\n| 19\n\nused is from a company in Budapest, and I\u2019m proposing we acquire them. We\ncould then integrate the technology seamlessly into our platform. If their technol-\nogy is in good shape, we\u2019d be able to launch a first version in a few months. In\nthe meantime, we could figure out a partnership to help people in the shorter\nterm,\u201d Karen finished.\n\u201cWhat are the risks to doing this?\u201d asked the CFO.\n\u201cWe have eliminated most of the risks,\u201d said Karen."

    "ground_truth": "Actual Root Cause: The team discovered that video editing was the biggest pain point. Teachers were spending upward of 80 hours over two months editing videos, or reshooting them to avoid editing, because they were marketing experts, not video experts. Validation: They ran a Concierge Experiment. The team pitched a video-editing service to teachers and manually edited videos for them for two weeks. This resulted in a publish rate increase from 25% to 75%, validating that solving the video editing problem would achieve their business goals."

    "question": "Explain the 'Strategic Gaps' identified by Stephen Bungay (The Knowledge Gap, The Alignment Gap, and The Effects Gap). For the 'Alignment Gap,' describe how organizations typically try to fill it incorrectly versus what they should do according to the text.",
    "response": "The Strategic Gaps identified by Stephen Bungay are crucial for understanding organizational inefficiencies. Here's an explanation of each:\n\n1. **Knowledge Gap**:  \n   This occurs when management knows more about a situation or product than the team does, leading to demands for excessive information. Instead of providing detailed data, effective strategies focus on communicating clear strategic intent so teams understand their direction without being overwhelmed by unnecessary details.\n\n2. **Alignment Gap**:  \n   This gap exists between what employees do and what management intends for them to achieve. Typical attempts to fill it involve imposing directives or passing feature requests down the hierarchy instead of setting shared outcomes. The recommended approach is for leadership to align each level around a common goal, allowing teams to figure out how to reach those objectives with autonomy.\n\n3. **Effects Gap**:  \n   This gap arises when actions intended to achieve certain results do not produce the expected outcomes. Organizations often address this by adding controls, which can hinder performance. The proper method is to grant teams freedom to adjust their actions based on goals and data, aligning with overall strategy without unnecessary constraints.\n\nIn summary, each strategic gap highlights how organizations can either correct a misalignment in understanding or restrict team autonomy, both of which impede effective action and growth.",

      "Strategic Gaps\nWhile studying strategy in many organizations, Stephen Bungay discovered that,\nwhen companies approach strategy as a plan, they often fail to achieve what they\nexpected. This failure stems from the actions taken to fill the following gaps that\nexist between outcomes, plans, and actions. These gaps ultimately cause friction\nwithin the organization:\n\u2022 The Knowledge Gap\n\u2022 The Alignment Gap\n\u2022 The Effects Gap\nThe Knowledge Gap\nThe Knowledge Gap (Figure 11-1) is the difference between what management\nwould like to know and what the company actually knows. Organizations try to\nfill this gap by providing and demanding more detailed information.\nFigure 11-1. The Knowledge Gap, by Stephen Bungay from the Art of Action (reprinted by per-\nmission of Hodder & Stoughton)\n65\n| 11\n\nIf you\u2019re a leader saying to yourself, \u201cOh, damn, that\u2019s me,\u201d you are not\nalone. These were the exact words that popped out of the mouth of a CEO when I\nintroduced this concept to him. This issue is probably the most readily recogniza-\nble of the gaps.\nWe also saw this gap surface with the CTO of Marquetly. He demanded that\nwe lay out every single detail of a not-yet-validated product so that he could feel\nmore certain about what we were doing. A deluge of information isn\u2019t always that\nhelpful for upper management. You need to focus on communicating and asking\nfor just enough information to make a decision.\nInstead of seeking more detailed information, upper management should be\nlimiting its direction to defining and communicating the strategic intent, or the\ngoals of the business. The strategic intents combine to communicate where the\ncompany is heading and what it desires to achieve when it gets there. The strate-\ngic intent points the team toward the outcomes the businesses wants to achieve.\nIn the case with Marquetly, there were too many unknowns at the time to\nmake a detailed plan. It still did not understand why users were falling off at cer-\ntain steps of the sign-up flow. This was the core problem it needed to understand\nbefore coming up with the right solution. The company needed room to experi-\nment and to understand why before it could suggest how to solve the problem.",
      "This was the core problem it needed to understand\nbefore coming up with the right solution. The company needed room to experi-\nment and to understand why before it could suggest how to solve the problem.\nConsider a product manager telling you the following: \u201cI\u2019m building this\nbecause it\u2019s going to help increase acquisitions, and new customer-acquisition is\nour big goal to drive the revenue prioritized at the corporate level. I know my\nproduct can bring people in. We know there\u2019s a problem here, but we\u2019re not sure\nwhat it is yet. Our next step is to discover that problem, tackle it with a solution,\nand then try to optimize the solution so we can increase acquisition.\u201d That\u2019s\nsomeone telling the story. A product manager who told you this should inspire\nconfidence. Unfortunately, the opposite is usually true.\nLeaders will still go through the ranks demanding more detailed informa-\ntion. Often, this is perceived as a lack of trust, and often it is, but there\u2019s usually\nsomething more there. In every organization where I\u2019ve seen leaders operate this\nway, the story is not complete. Typically, there\u2019s a lack of alignment, and the\ngoals of the team do not line up to an overall vision and strategy of the company.\nThis Alignment Gap is what truly causes the demand for more and more infor-\nmation.\n66 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\nThe Alignment Gap\nThe Alignment Gap, shown in Figure 11-2, is the difference between what people\ndo and what management wants them to do, which is to achieve the business\ngoals. Organizations try to fill this gap by providing more detailed instruction;\nwhereas, instead, they should allow each level within the company to define how\nit will achieve the intent of the next level up.\nFigure 11-2. The Alignment Gap, by Stephen Bungay from the Art of Action (reprinted by per-\nmission of Hodder & Stoughton)\nAt one company, I walked around asking all of the product managers on the\nhundred or so teams why they were working on their current project. I then\nasked their leaders the same question. I got two different answers from these two\ndifferent levels. They could not connect the activities of the teams back to the out-\ncomes of the companies because leadership had passed down feature requests\nrather than expected outcomes and goals.",
      "Instead of sending down mandates, organizations should, instead, turn to\naligning every level of the company around the why and should give the next\nlayer down the opportunity to figure out the how and report back. When done\nthis way, product management is successful. When leadership is not aligned at\nthe top, the issues trickle all the way down to the teams. The lack of meaning and\nfocus spreads, and, at the end of the year, the company will look at their target\ngoals and ask, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lack of leadership alignment is by far the big-\ngest issue I see standing in the way of successful product management.\nThe Effects Gap\nThe Effects Gap (Figure 11-3) is the difference between what we expect our\nactions to achieve and what actually happens. When organizations do not see the\nresults they want, they try to fill this gap by putting more controls in place. How-\never, that is the worst thing you can do in this scenario. Giving individuals and\nteams the freedom to adjust their actions so that they are in line with their goals\nis what will truly allow them to achieve results.\n68 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\nFigure 11-3. The Effects Gap, by Stephen Bungay from the Art of Action (reprinted by permission\nof Hodder & Stoughton)\nAll of these misguided, knee-jerk reactions start to pile up. Instead of align-\ning a team with a framework of goals and direction and then stepping back to\ngive that team the room to explore how to reach the goals, management usually\nswings a complete 180 degrees. It asks for more information. It expects teams to\ncommit to what management wants to do over the next year. It prescribes fully\nthought-out solutions, and then product teams are restricted to only those param-\neters instead of being able to focus on learning and adjusting their decisions as\nthey go.\nTo solve these various gaps and to deliver great products to your customers,\nyou need to view strategy in a different way, and, as Bungay proposes, enable\naction to achieve results. But why do we care about strategy being something that\nenables action? Well, that is how you scale an organization\u2014by enabling action\nthrough autonomous teams.\nAutonomous Teams\nAt Marquetly, the product managers were very frustrated by their lack of\nautonomy.",
      "I got two different answers from these two\ndifferent levels. They could not connect the activities of the teams back to the out-\ncomes of the companies because leadership had passed down feature requests\nrather than expected outcomes and goals. As soon as those feature requests were\ncommitted, it was nearly impossible to change them because the company\nexpected them to be delivered.\nAlthough I\u2019ve witnessed this at many companies, there is one example that\nalways haunts me. I was training product managers at a very large and estab-\nlished company (let\u2019s call it Company B), when I was told that it could not do any\nvalidation work around its products because the solutions the teams were build-\ning were already committed to the leadership of the company. Why? Well, Com-\npany B had hired a huge consulting firm to explore and dictate its product\nroadmap for the next five years. The consultants poured over market research\nSTRATEGIC GAPS | 67\n\nand competitive analyses and came up with a roadmap, which then trickled down\nto the teams.\nThese teams, meanwhile, had been talking to customers and knew that these\nsolutions the consultants had come up with were not what customers wanted.\nYet their performance reviews were based on delivering those products. They\nwanted to do right by the customer, but they couldn\u2019t, for fear of losing their jobs.\nAnd so they built the wrong thing\u2014knowingly. At the end of the year, Company\nB missed all of its goals, and the teams were penalized, even though they deliv-\nered on their roadmaps.\nWhen these teams realized that customers did not want the consultant-\nproposed solution, they should have had the freedom to explore alternative\noptions. That is how a product-led organization would operate. This is what\nkeeps us out of the build trap. Instead, their adherence to predetermined meet-\nings and formalities trapped them into staying quiet. Product teams need the\nfreedom to explore solutions and to adjust their actions according to the data they\nreceive. As long as they are aligned with the overall strategic intents and vision\nfor the company, management should feel comfortable granting the necessary\nautonomy to capable teams.\nInstead of sending down mandates, organizations should, instead, turn to\naligning every level of the company around the why and should give the next\nlayer down the opportunity to figure out the how and report back.",
      "Well, that is how you scale an organization\u2014by enabling action\nthrough autonomous teams.\nAutonomous Teams\nAt Marquetly, the product managers were very frustrated by their lack of\nautonomy. One experienced product manager told me, \u201cI keep having leaders tell\nme to own the vision of my product, but I\u2019m not allowed. My manager keeps\nhanding me solutions. Every time I try to suggest something different, I\u2019m shut\ndown. When we went Agile, we were told that our Scrum teams were supposed\nto be autonomous. This is definitely not autonomy.\u201d\nSTRATEGIC GAPS | 69\n\nTalking to the leaders of Marquetly, I heard a different story. \u201cOur product\nmanagers won\u2019t step up and own the product. I have to keep prescribing things\nfor them, but it\u2019s because they don\u2019t take initiative.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an interesting dichotomy but a common one I\u2019ve seen in companies\nstuck in the build trap. These are all symptoms of not having a good strategy\nframework that enables action. When teams are not aligned with a clear direction\nand goals, they cannot effectively make decisions. If they dare to try, much of the\ntime, the leader steps in and says, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not right.\u201d\nAutonomy is what allows organizations to scale. The alternative is hiring\nhundreds or thousands of middle managers that lead by authority, telling people\nwhat to do. As organizations grow to the thousands\u2014or even tens of thousands\n\u2014of employees, this becomes incredibly inefficient and costly. It also causes\nunnecessary layers in management and a lot of frustration. People end up\nunhappy, and unhappy people rarely produce great work.\nLeading by authority is a relic of industrial-age methodologies\u2014when low-\nskilled workers were supervised closely so that their output was maximized. In\nthe world of software, we don\u2019t work this way. We\u2019re hiring incredibly smart peo-\nple and paying them hundreds of thousands of dollars to make the decisions on\nhow to grow companies by making complex software that customers love. When\nyou have that sort of talent, you need to give them the room to make decisions so\nthat you can get the full benefit of their knowledge and skill.\nThat\u2019s what a strategic framework promotes."
