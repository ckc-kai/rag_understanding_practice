MAGAZINE, JULY -\nAUGUST 2014.\nPreface\nThe point is, you can\u2019t keep doing the same thing and expect it to keep\nworking. We had to do something different, but the really hard question\nwas, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d We made plenty of mistakes along the way to answering\nthat question, but the most important thing we identified was that we\nneeded to know more about our customers and what problems they were\nreally trying to solve in their businesses\u2014even if they didn\u2019t neatly fit into\nan existing category of ours.\n\u2014MICHAEL DELL1\nThis book is for every product person. It\u2019s for the senior in college who wants to\nbe a product manager but doesn\u2019t quite understand the full landscape of the job.\nIt\u2019s for the first-time product manager who was thrown into the fray and is look-\ning for guidance. It\u2019s for the product manager, just promoted to VP, who needs a\nguide to set up their organization so that it scales successfully. It\u2019s for the leaders\nof large organizations who are looking to obtain that competitive advantage.\nAbout a decade ago, I was working as a product manager in an e-commerce\ncompany, chugging along, writing large requirement documents, shipping them\nto developers, and, frankly, thinking that I was the bomb. A much-needed dose of\nreality was thrown in my face when we began measuring the success of our prod-\nucts. I soon learned that my products were crap, and no one was using them.\nThat was my first realization that I was in what I now call, the build trap. I\nwas so focused on shipping features and developing as many cool ideas (but\nmostly my own ideas) as I could that I didn\u2019t even think about the outcome of\nxi\n\nthose features. I wasn\u2019t connecting the goals of my company or the needs of my\nusers back to my work.\nI wanted to get better. I wanted to create better products. At that time, the\nLean Startup movement was taking shape and I learned about experimentation.\nAn engineer by background, this spoke to me. \u201cYou mean I can test things in my\nwork, just like science? I can use data to inform decisions?

I can use data to inform decisions? Sign me up,\u201d I\nthought.\nI eagerly applied all the things I learned to my job as a product manager. I\nstarted seeing traction on my features. I began working with my team better.\nTogether we became a lean, mean experimentation machine. And it worked: our\nproducts became better.\nThat experience inspired me. I wanted to learn more. I wanted more chances\nto implement these ways of working. I became a kid in a candy shop, soaking up\nevery process and framework that would make me a better product manager.\nA few years later, I began getting invited to share my experiences at confer-\nences. I loved being able to talk about what I learned and how it helped me. I\nsoon realized it was helping other people, too. More and more product managers,\nleaders, and designers came to me for advice. Eventually, in 2014, I became a\nconsultant.\nFor the past few years, I have been brought in to teach product managers\nthis systematic way of working. \u201cOur product managers are stuck,\u201d the executives\nwould tell me. \u201cThey need to learn how to talk to customers and think experi-\nmentally.\u201d The product managers I worked with were eager to learn, usually\ntransferring in from another part of the company with no prior experience. They\nreadily adopted the techniques, so excited to have a framework. I was thrilled.\nHelping people, seeing them get better, I found my calling\u2014developing the\nfuture of product management.\nI started writing Escaping the Build Trap two years ago for those very product\nmanagers. I wanted to help them become better.\nBut that evolved.\nI never intended to take two years to write this book. It was supposed to be a\nthree-month process. But, as I was nearing the end of my first draft, I was also\nchecking back in with the product managers I had been teaching. A pattern had\nemerged. They had slipped back into old habits.\n\u201cWhy are you not talking to users? Why did you stop experimenting?\u201d I\nasked.\nThey cited a bunch of systemic problems.\nxii | Preface\n\n\u201cMy bonus is tied to the features we ship.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80214bbd-2446-4e41-b3c3-18d6c8e21972": {"__data__": {"id_": "80214bbd-2446-4e41-b3c3-18d6c8e21972", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Preface", "start_page_idx": 12, "end_page_idx": 16}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\u201cWhy are you not talking to users?

I need to get those out because it\u2019s\ngetting close to the end of the year,\u201d I heard at one company.\n\u201cMy manager was getting upset because we were not shipping. We were\ndoing user research, but they couldn\u2019t see the value in it. I had to get something\nout the door or I\u2019d get in trouble,\u201d said another.\nI soon realized that it was not just the product managers that were stuck in\nthe build trap, but the entire organization. Solving the processes for the team was\nnot enough. It was about setting up the entire company to support good product\nmanagement.\nSo I began rewriting this book to focus on the product-led organization.\nThen I was invited to lead a few large-scale product transformations at\nmultibillion-dollar companies. I advised the C-Suite on becoming product-led,\nagain eager to implement what I had learned. Little did I know how much I\nwould learn through those experiences, in return.\nThe version of Escaping the Build Trap you are about to read is the fourth\nrewrite of this book in three years. It is a culmination of what I have learned\nabout how roles, strategy, process, and organizational dynamics affect the value\nthat a company can deliver.\nThis book is a guide to getting out of the build trap with great product man-\nagement. We look at what it means to become and be a product-led organization\n(Figure P-1), which involves four key components:\n\u2022 Creating a product manager role with the right responsibilities and struc-\nture\n\u2022 Enabling those product managers with a strategy that promotes good deci-\nsion making\n\u2022 Understanding the process of determining what product to build, through\nexperimentation and optimization\n\u2022 Supporting everyone with the right organizational policies, culture, and\nrewards to allow product management to thrive\nPreface | xiii\n\nFigure P-1.

It\u2019s when they focus more on ship-\nping and developing features rather than on the actual value those things\nproduce. When companies stop producing real value for the users, they\nbegin to lose market share, allowing them to be disrupted. Companies can\nget out of the build trap by setting themselves up to develop intentional\nand robust product management practices. At that point, product manag-\ners can find the opportunities to maximize business and customer value.\n1\nPART | I\n\n\u201cChris, your problem isn\u2019t just your product managers,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re defi-\nnitely green, and you\u2019re going to have to hire some more senior people, but you\nhave process, strategy, and organizational issues, as well, that are preventing you\nfrom hitting your goals.\u201d\nThe CEO of Marquetly, Chris, had called me to talk frankly about the state of\nMarquetly, an education company that provides online training for marketers.\nExperts in digital marketing, Marquetly professionals create classes through their\nonline platform that any individual can take for a monthly subscription.\nSix months earlier, Chris had hired me to train and coach the company\u2019s\nproduct managers. Marquetly was growing rapidly, with revenue growth year-\nover-year holding steady around 30%. The company hired hundreds of people in\na very short amount of time, assigning them to all sorts of projects. Many of\nthose people were developers, and they soon learned they needed product manag-\ners to work with them, after adopting an Agile framework called Scrum.\nThey moved marketing people, individuals with no prior experience in prod-\nuct management, into that role to work with the developers because they knew\nthe audience for the school best. Marquetly\u2019s story was similar to those of other\ncompanies I had advised, and I knew that the issues were probably deeper than\njust skill based.\nWhen I came into the company, I met with its VP of product, Karen. She had\nbeen hired three months earlier to oversee the dozens of new product managers.\n\u201cI am under a ridiculous amount of pressure,\u201d Karen told me. \u201cThe sales\nteam has promised all of these features to enterprise clients. We\u2019ve never serv-\niced people in that market before, and now we have to build everything from\nscratch.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6bba7c72-cbd7-4f89-b31e-e56a44b09f81": {"__data__": {"id_": "6bba7c72-cbd7-4f89-b31e-e56a44b09f81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Part I.

I have no time to\nbe strategic at all.\u201d\nThe sales teams were frustrated, as well, and felt backed into a corner. \u201cWe\nneed roadmaps, no one gives us anything to sell. This is how I make my money.\nI\u2019m only out there promising things because the product teams aren\u2019t giving me\nanything,\u201d the head of sales told me.\nThe entire organization was at a standoff, with everyone pointing fingers at\none another. All of them cited the lack of product management skills as the prob-\nlem. \u201cIf only our product managers had deeper backlogs,\u201d the CTO lamented.\n\u201cWe would be set. We need them to start thinking of more solutions.\u201d\nSo I got to work with the product managers. I assessed their skills early on,\nwatched them interact with their development and design teams, and gave them\n2 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\nnew frameworks to try. After about a month and a half, I had to break it to Chris\nthat he needed to hire more experienced people if he wanted to succeed.\n\u201cKaren cannot be the only leader they are learning from here,\u201d I explained.\n\u201cShe has no time to mentor and coach dozens of people. If you want to grow the\njunior people, you will have to move some of these people back to the content\ndivision and hire real product managers.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, we can train them,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe can\u2019t hire a ton of new people.\nJust keep teaching them. Hire another coach if we need to.\u201d\nI continued on with the training and brought in another coach to help. Many\nof the product managers were excited for the frameworks and the guidance. They\nreadily adopted them, and, with some, we saw glimpses of early success in the\nway they approached problems and thought about their work. But that momen-\ntum was short lived.\nWhen the teams did not have anything to ship by the third month, the lead-\nership team became incensed. \u201cThey are not doing their jobs!\u201d said the CEO.\n\u201cWe need to ship more features.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b459d9f-d0c2-4280-980d-8ea891aa4d4c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b459d9f-d0c2-4280-980d-8ea891aa4d4c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Part I.

Why are they not prioritizing better?\u201d All fingers\npointed back to bad product management. But that wasn\u2019t the actual problem.\nThe company was running in too many directions. At one point, there were\n20 major projects in progress. When I say major, I really mean major. A new\nmobile app was being developed, along with a new backend system for the teach-\ners to monitor their classes. These were large undertakings, meant for multiple\nteams, but only one product manager\u2014and a junior one at that\u2014and one devel-\nopment team were assigned to each.\nThey tried all they could to meet their deadlines, while practicing great prod-\nuct management techniques, but they were not set up for success. Deadlines had\nbeen set before I had come in. The different projects were committed to custom-\ners in their contracts. Whenever I suggested that we evaluate whether we should\nreally be building a certain feature, there was a considerable amount of pushback\nfrom the product managers. \u201cLeadership told me to do this.

It was too little, too late.\nMicrosoft, although not in danger of failing immediately, was on the path to\ndisruption. It had been using the same strategic recipe over and over again,\ncounting on Windows to carry its business, until CEO Satya Nadella came in.

Instead of\nassociating value with the outcomes they want to create for their businesses and\ncustomers, they measure value by the number of things they produce. Marquetly\nwas a clear example of this when the leaders celebrated the 10 features the com-\npany shipped in a single month, but none of those features achieved their goals.\nLet\u2019s go back to the basics to determine what true value is. Fundamentally,\ncompanies operate on a value exchange, as shown in Figure 1-1.\nFigure 1-1. The value exchange\nOn one side, customers and users have problems, wants, and needs. On the\nother side are businesses that create products or services to resolve those prob-\nlems and to fulfill those wants and needs. The customer realizes value only when\n7\n| 1\n\nthese problems are resolved and these wants and needs are fulfilled. Then, and\nonly then, do they provide value back to the business, as shown in Figure 1-2.\nFigure 1-2. The value exchange realized\nValue, from a business perspective, is pretty straightforward. It\u2019s something\nthat can fuel your business: money, data, knowledge capital, or promotion. Every\nfeature you build and any initiative you take as a company should result in some\noutcome that is tied back to that business value.\nBut value can be difficult to measure and to measure well from a customer\nor user perspective. Products and services are not inherently valuable. It\u2019s what\nthey do for the customer or user that has the value\u2014solving a problem, for exam-\nple, or fulfilling a desire or need. Doing this repeatedly and reliably is what\nguides a company to success.\nWhen companies do not understand their customers\u2019 or users\u2019 problems\nwell, they cannot possibly define value for them. Instead of doing the work to\nlearn this information about customers, they create a proxy that is easy to meas-\nure. \u201cValue\u201d becomes the quantity of features that are delivered, and, as a result,\nthe number of features shipped becomes the primary metric of success.\nThese companies then motivate their employees and judge them for success\nwith the same proxies.

This way of thinking is detri-\nmental yet pervasive.\n8 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\nI once worked with a company that made a data platform for enterprise com-\npanies. It had a total of 30 features, with about 40 more on the backlog, when I\ncame in. When I measured the customer use of those existing features, we dis-\ncovered people used only 2% of them consistently. And yet, development was\nunderway to add more, instead of trying to reevaluate what they already had.\nHow did they end up there? A few reasons, and these apply to many compa-\nnies stuck in the build trap. The company was playing a game of catch-up\u2014try-\ning to fast-follow its competitors on every feature it released. It didn\u2019t even know\nwhether these features were working out well for their competitors, but manage-\nment insisted on parity. This is the same trap Google+ fell into with Facebook\u2014\nnever differentiating enough, just copying.\nThe company also overpromised during the sales process, giving customers\nwhatever it took to get the contract signed. The result was a ton of one-off fea-\ntures that satisfied the needs of only one client, rather than a strategic choice to\nbuild what would scale for many clients.\nInstead of analyzing how each of these features provided unique value to its\ncustomers and moving the company strategy forward, the organization was stuck\nin reactive mode. It was not building with intent. And yet, it thought of itself as a\nsuccessful company because it had a million features to talk about at user confer-\nences. The company lost sight of what made its product attractive to customers\u2014\nwhat made the company special.\nYou have to get to know your customers and users, deeply understanding\ntheir needs, to determine which products and services will fulfill needs both from\nthe customer side and the business side.

Many companies operate on a project-based development\ncycle, in which they scope out work to be done, create deadlines and milestones,\nand then have the teams get to work. When the project is over, they move on to\nthe next project. Many of these projects have their own measures of outcomes,\nbut there is no aligning strategy above them.\nThere are many best-practice frameworks and certifications out there that\npromote project management\u2013type thinking: PRojects IN Controlled Environ-\nments (PRINCE2), Project Management Institute, and Project Management\nBody of Knowledge (PMBOK). Companies stuck in the build trap usually confuse\nthese frameworks for a product management framework.\nTo understand product management and how it differs from project man-\nagement, we first need to define what a product is and why it is important.\nProducts, as I said before, are vehicles of value. They deliver value repeatedly\nto customers and users, without requiring the company to build something new\nevery time. These can be hardware, software, consumer packaged goods, or any\nother artifacts in which human intervention is not needed to achieve value for the\nuser. Microsoft Excel, baby food, Tinder, the iPhone\u2014these are all products.\nServices, unlike products, use human labor to primarily deliver value to the\nuser. Service-based organizations are design agencies that create logos or brands\nfor businesses, or they could be accounting companies where an accountant does\nyour taxes. These services can be \u201cproductized,\u201d where they are the same service\nfor the same price for every customer, but they still inherently need people to exe-\n13\n| 3\n\ncute them. They can also be automated for scale, by creating a software product\nthat executes on the service.\nMany companies use a combination of products and services to deliver value.\nFor example, many software companies that have an on-premises model, mean-\ning they install the software directly on the computers of their users and have a\nservices team go in and do the installation, customization, and setup.

When projects are complete, the aim is reached, and you move\non to the next one. Projects are an essential part of product development, but the\nmentality of thinking only in projects will cause damage.\nA product is something that needs to be nurtured and grown to maturity.\nThis takes a long time. When you ship features to enhance a product, you are\ncontributing to this overall success. This feature enhancement is a project, but\nyour work may not be done when you are finished. You need to keep iterating by\nscoping out new projects to reach the overall outcome and be successful.\nThis is why the concept of product management\u2014and that of having product\nmanagers\u2014is so important for companies. You need the discipline to move\ntoward organizing for products over projects. Companies that optimize their\nproducts to achieve value are called product-led organizations. These organiza-\ntions are characterized by product-driven growth, scaling their organization\nthrough software products, and optimizing them until they reach the desired out-\ncomes.\n14 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae00f427-90da-4e64-9801-11d95b4d1063": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae00f427-90da-4e64-9801-11d95b4d1063", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Chapter 4.

They prioritize, organize, and\nstrategize around product success. This is what gets them out of the build trap.\nBut, if you\u2019re not product-led, what are you? Many companies are, instead,\nled by sales, visionaries, or technology. All of these ways of organizing can land\nyou in the build trap.\nSales-Led\nSales-led companies let their contracts define their product strategy. Remember\nmy example of the data platform that had 30 features that no one used? That was\na sales-led company. The product roadmap and direction were driven by what\nwas promised to customers, without aligning back to the overall strategy.\nMany small companies start off as sales-led, and that can be okay. As a\nstartup, it\u2019s necessary to close that first big client and get the revenue needed to\ncontinue operating. So they\u2019ll go above and beyond for that client, working\nclosely with them to define the product roadmap, taking all of their requests, and\nsometimes customizing things especially for them. But this way of working does\nnot scale for long. When you have 50 to 100 customers or more, you cannot build\neverything uniquely to match the needs of each one, unless you want to be a\nbespoke agency. If that is not in the cards for you, you need to change your strat-\negy to building features that apply to everyone, without customization.\nYet many companies that do not want to go the bespoke route operate as\nsales-led for far longer than they should.

This leaves no room for product teams to strategize or explore what\ncould push the company further.\nVisionary-Led\nThe easiest way to think of a visionary-led company is to consider Apple. Steve\nJobs propelled that company forward, creating the product strategy, and got it\nover the hurdles of failed products to the success it is today. He pushed the\nboundaries of what was known, and the rest of the company followed.\nVisionary-led companies can be very powerful\u2014when you have the right\nvisionary. But, there aren\u2019t too many Steve Jobses floating around. Also, when\nthat visionary leaves, what happens to the product direction? It usually crumbles.\nThis has been something Apple has had to contend with since CEO Tim Cook\ntook over. The world is wondering what is next for Apple, after it has built up its\nexisting products.\nOperating as a visionary-led company is not sustainable. Innovation needs to\nbe baked in to the system so that one person is not the weakest link. When you\nhave 5,000 brains working on a problem (as opposed to one), you can harness\nthat power better to succeed.\nTechnology-Led\nAnother common way of operating is the technology-led company. These compa-\nnies are driven by the latest and coolest technology. The problem is that they\noften suffer from a lack of a market-facing, value-led strategy.\nTechnology is critical to a software company\u2019s success, but it cannot drive the\nproduct strategy. The product strategy must lead. Companies that let their tech-\nnology lead the way often find themselves spinning their wheels, producing lots\nof very cool things, with no buyers.\nProduct strategy connects the business, market, and technology together so\nthat they are all working in harmony. You need to be able to lead with a value\nproposition for your users, or you will not be able to make money.\nProduct-Led\nThis brings us back to being a product-led company.

I printed it for my boss to review and had\nbeen sitting there staring at it for five minutes through teary eyes, the way one\nlooks at a beloved child. It had taken me a full week to prepare. Twenty-one pages\nlong, it consisted of 14 beautifully designed mock-ups and every error case\nknown to man. The developers were going to be so set. There would be no need\nto ask a single question. They would have everything they could possibly imagine\nin their hands to create the \u201cchange password\u201d page for our site.\nI did not even know what product management was until a few months ear-\nlier. At that first job, I learned that the role of the product manager was that of a\ncreator and an arbitrator. We connected the development teams with the busi-\nness, gathering requirements and translating them into features that people\ncould actually use. I would frequently meet with the sales team to learn about\nwhat our customers were requesting. A few times, we interviewed actual custom-\ners to learn about their habits and needs.

I never actually knew what they did with them, but I\nlearned that if I made them really detailed, the engineers wouldn\u2019t need to talk to\nme. According to most of my coworkers, that was considered a plus. So I would\nwrite up enormous documents\u201420- to 30-page product specifications detailing\nevery single aspect of a given feature. The specifications included what would go\ninto what that feature looked like and how it would function, all the way down to\nthe minute details of what would happen when you push a button. Additionally,\nthey covered scenarios, such as, what if there\u2019s an error state, or what if there\u2019s\nnothing entered in this form when you hit Submit? I was convinced that the\nmore detailed I made the spec, the better I was at being a product manager.\nWhen the spec document was done, it would be reviewed by my managers\nand shipped off to the developers.

Many of these steps stem from the work of product managers\nwho operate in a traditional Waterfall environment.

Swinging too far in that direction\nbrings us to the other most common archetype of the product manager: the\nwaiter.\nThe Waiter\nThe waiter is a product manager who, at heart, is an order taker. They go to their\nstakeholders, customers, or managers, ask for what they want, and turn those\nwants into a list of items to be developed. There is no goal. There is no vision.\nThere is no decision making involved. This was the archetype of 90% of the\nproduct owner teams at Marquetly.\nThe most common question I get from product managers in this position is,\n\u201cHow do I prioritize?\u201d Because they have no goal in which to provide context for\ntrade-offs, it becomes a popularity contest for whomever is making the request.\nMore often than not, the most important person gets their features prioritized.\nThis happens frequently in very large companies. The product managers go out,\nwith all the right intentions, to talk to their customers and learn what they want.\nBut, instead of discovering problems, waiters ask, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d The cus-\ntomer asks for a specific solution, and these product managers implement them.\nThis is where you end up in what my friend David Bland, product advisor and\nconsultant, calls the product death cycle, shown in Figure 6-1.\n28 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f2819b3-b494-4a1d-b829-90a9696d126e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f2819b3-b494-4a1d-b829-90a9696d126e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "The Former Project Manager", "start_page_idx": 46, "end_page_idx": 48}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Figure 6-1.

You need to deeply understand their\nproblems and then determine the best solutions for them.\nWaiters are reactive thinkers, not strategic thinkers. There\u2019s usually an\namount of learned helplessness that contributes to that. They don\u2019t believe that\nthey can push back on these solutions and dive deeper into problems. But that\u2019s\nnot true. Customers want their problems solved. Leaders want to hit goals. Push-\ning back is essential to building a successful product.

Because they are not focused on the why, they tend to focus\na lot on the when. Project managers who are put into product management roles\noften become waiters waving a calendar.\nThe Former Project Manager\nProduct managers are not project managers, although a little project manage-\nment is needed to execute on the role correctly.

They need to understand the market and how the business\nworks. They need to truly understand the vision and goal of the company. They\nalso need deep empathy for the users for whom they are building products, to\nunderstand their needs.\nThe title \u201cproduct manager\u201d is misleading in itself. An effective product\nmanager is not a manager. The position doesn\u2019t come with much direct author-\nity. To be effective team leaders, product managers need to recognize team mem-\nbers\u2019 strengths and to work with them to achieve the common goal. They need to\nconvince their team\u2014and the rest of the company\u2014that what they are working\ntoward is the right thing to be building.

Then they sift through and analyze that information,\nusing it to create a product vision that will help to further the company and to\nsolve the customers\u2019 needs.\nTo do that, a product manager must be humble enough in their approach to\nlearn and take into account that they don\u2019t know all of the answers. They need to\nknow that there are assumptions that they must tackle along the way, approach-\ning them with a scientific mindset to validate them and to reduce risk.

Product managers are not\nexperts in either of these domains; they are experts in product management. That\ndoesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t need knowledge in either of these areas. They need to\nknow just enough to talk with an engineer or a business person and to under-\nstand enough to make informed decisions.\nA product manager must be tech literate, not tech fluent. That means they\ncan discuss enough and understand enough about the technology to talk to devel-\nopers and to make trade-off decisions. They know the right questions to ask engi-\nneers to understand the complexity of certain features or improvements. A\nproduct manager doesn\u2019t need to be able to code unless the product is highly\ntechnical and it\u2019s essential they understand the technology deeply to make deci-\nsions.\nThe same goes for the market. Although it\u2019s valuable for a product manager\nto know the market well, this is something they can learn. This is all about bal-\nancing the skill sets of your team.

In\nmany retail banks and other organizations, product managers are not given the\nopportunity to ask why. They are handed features and solutions from stakehold-\ners or managers. Sometimes, these features are determined and committed dur-\ning annual budgeting season. Other times, this is just seen as the manager\u2019s job\n\u2014to dictate the solutions to build. When done this way, you invite the risk of fail-\nure, due to bias, in the execution of those solutions. All solution ideas are subject\nto bias, organizational or personal. The only way to fight this bias is to learn from\nusers and to experiment.\nIn many cases when organizations hand down solutions, they skip setting\nsuccess metrics and goals. Meghan\u2019s project could have gone very differently, if\nthis was the case for her and had she simply been told, \u201cMake the process of\napplying for a mortgage digital so that no one has to apply in person.\u201d Now what\nif she found that her customers did not want to apply online and were more com-\nfortable doing so in the office? What if making the process digital caused the rate\nof completion to decline drastically? How could she have made decisions to cor-\nrect those things, when she wasn\u2019t given the space to do so?\nThe biggest issue I hear from leaders, when I go in to help their organiza-\ntions become product-led, is that their product managers won\u2019t step up and \u201cown\nthe product.\u201d But, this is a double-edged sword.

This is where people usually become confused between what \nAgile calls a product owner and a product manager.\nWhen you look at the role of the product owner in most Scrum literature, the\nthree responsibilities of the position include the following:\n\u2022 Define the product backlog and create actionable user stories for the devel-\nopment teams.\n\u2022 Groom and prioritize the work in the backlog.\n\u2022 Accept the completed user stories to make sure the work fulfills the crite-\nria.\nThese are the functions that are focused on and taught in the shorter product\nowner trainings, usually over a day or two. Although Scrum has a lot of informa-\ntion on the processes and rituals of what to do as a product owner, it leaves lots of\nquestions unanswered and these questions are important for creating successful\nproducts:\n\u2022 How do we determine value?\n\u2022 How do we measure the success of our products in the market?\n\u2022 How do we make sure we are building the right thing?\n\u2022 How do we price and package our product?\n\u2022 How do we bring our product to market?\n\u2022 What makes sense to build versus buy?\n\u2022 How can we integrate with third-party software to enter new markets?\nProduct ownership is just a piece of product management. A good product\nmanager is taught how to prioritize work against clear, outcome-oriented goals,\nto define and discover real customer and business value, and to determine what\nprocesses are needed to reduce the uncertainty about the product\u2019s success in the\nmarket.\nWithout this background in product management, someone can effectively\ngo through the motions of the product owner role in Scrum, but they can never\nbe successful in making sure that they are building the right thing. In other\nwords, product owner is a role you play on a Scrum team. Product manager is a\ncareer.\nIf you take your Scrum team away, and Scrum as a process, you are still a\nproduct manager.

They worked together to define her goal, and her boss\ngave her space to go reach it. The company supported her in the work she needed\nto do to accomplish this. Most importantly, she had the advantage of being\nallowed to talk to her users.\nBy talking with the people who did not finish applying for their mortgage,\nshe learned about the document verification problem. That\u2019s where she was able\nto say, \u201cAha! I believe, if I can find a way to verify these documents, we can get\npeople to complete their mortgages.\u201d She found the problem to solve, rather than\nguessing at what needed to happen and then throwing solutions at problems that\nmight or might not exist.\nMeghan then worked with her team to figure out how to solve that problem.\nShe was not a one-woman show. She involved the developers, the designers, the\nstakeholders, and anyone else needed to successfully execute. She involved peo-\nple when she needed them. She did not take orders from stakeholders to create\nfeatures without first diagnosing the problem. Instead, she leaned on stakehold-\ners from the mortgage business to give her information and guidance as she craf-\nted the right solution. She focused on the users and what they needed, rather\nthan the wants of internal teams. After experimenting successfully, she was then\nable to rally the company around the vision for the entire feature.\nProduct managers ultimately play a few key roles, but one of the most impor-\ntant ones is being able to marry the business goals with the customer goals to\nachieve value.

What is the\ncareer path here? How do I keep them engaged and growing?\u201d We talked\nthrough the responsibilities and how things change as you become more senior.\nAs a product manager, your roles and responsibilities will change depending\non your context, the stage of your product, or your leadership position in the\norganization. Without a Scrum team or with a smaller team, you might be doing\nmore strategy and validation work for a product that has not been defined yet.\nWith a Scrum team, you might be more focused on the execution of solutions. As\na manager of product managers, you might be leading strategy for a larger part of\nthe product and coaching your teams to discover and execute well.\nScaled Agile Framework (SAFe) teaches this differently, and I think it\u2019s one\nof the weakest points in the entire framework. In SAFe, product managers are\nthe managers of product owners and are responsible for external-facing interac-\ntions and work. They speak to the customers, they define the requirements and\nscope of the products to be built, and they communicate these down to the prod-\nuct owners. The product owners are internal facing, defining the components of\nthe solution and working with developers to ship it.\nI\u2019ve trained dozens of teams who are using SAFe, and I have never seen it\nwork well. Although the appeal of having a framework that lays out everything\nyou need to do technology-wise in nice neat boxes sounds appealing, in practice\nit usually breaks down. The product owners are disconnected from their users\nand incapable of creating effective solutions because they do not understand the\nproblems well. The product managers are essentially Waterfalling down the\nrequirements, and the teams are not allowed to prove whether these are the right\nthings to build. No one is doing validation work.\nI have listened to many arguments that product owners do not have time to\ndo both roles. In the current context, that\u2019s true. The product owners I speak with\nspend 40 hours a week writing tons of user stories. At that point, you need to\nask, are those user stories even valuable?

The amount of external\nversus internal work will shift, depending on the maturity and success of your\nproduct. But, you should never be doing all this work at once.\nI teach my clients that product managers in senior roles (VPs, product leads,\nor middle managers) concentrate on defining the vision and strategy for the\nteams based on market research, an understanding of company goals and strat-\negy, and by looking at the current state of success of their products. The product\nmanagers without Scrum teams or with smaller teams (a UX designer and one\ndeveloper, for example) help validate and contribute to that strategy for future\nproducts. After we validate the direction, we create larger Scrum teams around\nthese people and build out solutions.\nIt\u2019s important to have this flexibility in team size, as well, depending on the\nstage of your product. If you give a product manager a large Scrum team\u2019s back-\nlog to maintain while you are in discovery mode, they will keep that backlog fil-\nled. But they will also be torn between keeping work flowing to the developers\nand trying to do the work to validate direction. As a result, neither ends up done\nwell.\nIf you want to build products that create value for your businesses and cus-\ntomers, you need good product management foundations in your company. If\nyou want a career path for your people, you need to give them this foundation so\nthat they can grow into more senior roles. So remind your people to think like\nproduct managers.

This introduces more levels in\nthe product management organization, and the responsibilities of these people\nchange depending on the amount of tactical, strategic, and operational work they\ndo.\nTactical work for a product manager focuses on the shorter-term actions of\nbuilding features and getting them out the door.

They are the ones on the ground\nfloor, talking to users, synthesizing the data, making the decisions from a feature\nperspective. Product managers are usually responsible for a feature or a set of\nfeatures that are part of a larger packaged product.\nIt\u2019s a difficult role. The product manager needs to be strategic enough to help\ncraft the vision of the features and how they fit into the overall product but tacti-\ncal enough to ensure a smooth execution of the solution. They tend to skew more\noperational than strategic at this level because the responsibilities are around the\nshorter-term impact and delivery of features on the roadmap.

A\ndirector of product becomes necessary to help promote strategic alignment and\noperational efficiency, connecting their product group back to the product or\nportfolio vision.\nThe director of product is the first level of people management. They oversee\na group of product managers who are aligned around a product in a portfolio or\nproduct line. The director of product is responsible for the strategic roadmap of\nthe product, usually looking at a time horizon of a year. They are also responsible\nfor the operational effectiveness of the team, making sure all product managers\nare aligned by the appropriate goals and working on the most important items to\nmove the product forward.\nVP of Product\nNext is a VP of product. Someone in this role oversees the strategy and operations\nfor an entire product line.\nThe VP of product is responsible for connecting the company goals back to\nthe growth of their product line. With inputs from the people on their team and\nthe data they provide, they set the vision and goals for the overall product. In\nlarge, enterprise companies, VPs of product are also directly responsible for the\nfinancial success of their product line, not just the delivery of product features.\nAll the VPs of product in a large company must be aligned in their strategy and\npurpose, to ensure a successful portfolio of products.\nA VP of product is usually the highest level in smaller companies because\nthere is only one product and not multiple product lines. In these companies, the\nVPs of product are often responsible for a product team of one or just a few, and\nthey have to dive into tactical aspects of product work to ensure that things get\ndone. This means that these people tend to be more entrepreneurial and great at\nlaunching and growing new products.\nIn practice, VPs of product tend to skew either more strategic or more tacti-\ncal. There are VPs who are great at being a product manager and at doing the\nwork to grow a product themselves.

This also allows them to grow\ninto the role of CPO, which is primarily strategic.\nChief Product Officer\nThe CPO is a fairly new yet critical role for organizations. A CPO oversees a com-\npany\u2019s entire product portfolio. This is the highest role of a product manager, and\nit represents a seat at the executive table of a company.\nA company should think about adding a CPO when it starts to develop its\nsecond product, expands into another geography, or merges with another com-\npany. This role is critical to ensure that the entire portfolio is working together to\nachieve the company goals.\nThe CPO is responsible for driving the economic success of the business\nthrough the growth of the product portfolio. Although a VP of product needs to\nunderstand how their product roadmap affects the economics of the company, a\nCPO needs to do that across all products. They work with the VPs of product to\nensure that every product is strategically aligned to the company\u2019s objectives and\nthat each product has what it needs, from a resource and people perspective, to\nreach the established goals.\nA CPO needs to be able to interface at the board level, as well. Shelley Perry,\na venture partner for Insight Venture Partners and an expert on the role of the\nCPOs, explains it as follows: \u201cBoard members care about the financial impacts of\nthe technology and product decisions. A successful CPO needs to be able to\ntranslate their actions into terms the board will understand.\u201d\nPerry helps find the best CPOs for Insight\u2019s portfolio companies, which are\nall growth-stage software companies.

Other factors,\nlike current state, financial objective, and rate of organizational change, must\ncome into play. By empathizing with the other members of their peer group,\ntheir customers, and their teams, CPOs can find a way forward that aligns all the\ngoals. This allows them to also traverse adjacent industries and to immerse\nthemselves in the customer perspective.\nFinally, a CPO must be relentless and resilient. They need the desire to dig\nin and find out what is working and what is not. They are constantly assessing\nand analyzing, trying to prove their hypotheses right or wrong, and holding\nthemselves accountable to data. When something does not work as planned, they\nneed the tenacity to keep digging and find out what will.\nHaving a strong product leader in the C-Suite is a critical step to becoming\nproduct-led. Unfortunately, there are not many CPOs available on the market at\nthe moment, because this field is still emerging. My company, Produx Labs, has\npartnered with Insight Venture Partners to create a CPO Accelerator that devel-\nops VPs of product into CPOs for their companies.

Companies tend to organize in three main\nways: value streams, features, and technical components.\nWhen I came in, Marquetly was structured around technical components.\n\u201cOur Agile coach suggested we put Scrum teams over every area of our product\nso we have coverage,\u201d said the CTO. Although this makes sense in theory, in\npractice it helped to promote poor product management.\nDuring a workshop for the product team on good product management\nskills, I was stressing the importance of solid foundations, when one of the prod-\nuct owners chimed in. \u201cMost of this is really great. I\u2019d like to work this way, but I\ncan\u2019t because I have to keep the backlogs full for our login API. If I don\u2019t do that,\nmy developers won\u2019t have anything to do.\u201d\n\u201cIs it a new API?\u201d I asked. \u201cAre there massive issues with it right now that\nyou\u2019re trying to fix?\u201d Turns out there were no major problems with it.

This did not need to be\nworked on to achieve the company goals, and yet here she was creating work for\nher team because she had been told it was what she owned and could work on.\n49\n| 9\n\nA similar issue happens when teams are organized around specific features.\nA lot of teams do this to get coverage\u2014ownership over every part of the product.\nAlthough this is good if you are literally starting from scratch and do not have a\nproduct organization set up, but, over time, it promotes a very output-oriented\nmindset. Instead of working toward a goal and saying no to anything that doesn\u2019t\nget us there, we tend to look for ways to develop more things related to our little\nslice of the product.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5bf8f0e2-dd5b-40d3-9a07-e17cddb18df2": {"__data__": {"id_": "5bf8f0e2-dd5b-40d3-9a07-e17cddb18df2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Chapter 9.

When features are sta-\nble, we should monitor them but then move on to the more important work\nneeded to support our strategy.\nBut, you might be asking: don\u2019t you want teams to own all features so that\nyou have a way to make sure someone is looking after them? Yes and no. To\norganize teams effectively, you need to balance the coverage and scope of teams\nwith the goals you are trying to achieve.\nWhen companies are small, you can organize effectively around goals you\nare trying to reach. Consider how TransferWise does it. This London-based com-\npany does electronic transfers. You can send money to different countries in\nother currencies with very low fees, compared to what the banks charge. Trans-\nferWise has a relatively small number of product teams at around 12. The way\nthey organize their teams\u2014around strategic goals\u2014allows them to stay small\nand still get an immense amount of work done.\nOne team is focused on retention, another on implementing new currencies,\nand another on acquiring new users. Each of the teams has ownership of their\ngoal and is judged for success based on their outcomes. They are also allowed to\nwork across all products to do whatever is needed to reach those goals. It takes a\nhuge amount of coordination across the product teams, so everyone is responsi-\nble for collaborating intensely with one another. Even though the coordination\nmight seem like a handful, having fewer teams makes them ruthlessly prioritize\naround the most important initiatives. There\u2019s no useless work.\nThis structure also creates a nice redundancy throughout the company, so\nthat important information about a single product is not stuck in the head of one\nperson. If someone leaves, they don\u2019t need to worry about all that ingrained\nknowledge going with them.

As compa-\nnies scale, and especially as they begin to maintain more than one product, this\napproach might not be a viable option. We have to add in another component to\norganizing teams, but we still want to keep the product strategy and the goal-\noriented nature. In addition to these things, we also look at the value streams of\nthe organization.\nA value stream is all of the activities needed to deliver value to the customer.\nThat includes the processes, from discovering the problem, setting the goals, and\nconceiving of the idea, to delivering the actual product or service. Every organiza-\ntion should strive to optimize this flow in order to get value out the door faster to\ncustomers. To do that, it makes sense to organize your teams around the value\nstream.\nHow do you organize this way? First you begin with the customer or user\u2014\nwhomever is consuming your product at the end of the day. What is the value\nthat you are providing them? Then work backward. What are the touchpoints\nthey have with your company on the way to receiving that value? Having identi-\nfied these, how do you organize to optimize and streamline that journey for\nthem? How do you optimize to provide more value, faster?\nMany companies are confused by the word product. You say product and peo-\nple think of an app, a feature, or an interface. If you think back to our diagram on\nthe value exchange in Figure 1-1, products are vehicles for value. So, if your app,\ninterface, or feature is not inherently adding value on its own, it\u2019s just a piece of\nthe entire product. That doesn\u2019t mean no one needs to manage it. It just means\nyou have to look beyond just that piece to understand how to manage for value\ndelivery and creation.\nConsider an insurance company.

As the internet\nbecame faster, the company expected to see more people downloading videos on\ndemand rather than receiving DVDs by mail. It made sense from a strategy\nstandpoint\u2014instant entertainment is definitely convenient. And yet, not as many\npeople were adopting this offering as they had hoped. Why?\nStepping back and looking at the situation from the customer\u2019s point of\nview, Netflix realized that the only internet-enabled devices at the time were lap-\ntops and home computers. That wasn\u2019t the most convenient or delightful way to\nwatch movies all of the time. Occasionally, yes, but it wasn\u2019t the preferred way to\nconstantly consume entertainment. Most people would rather watch them on a\nbig screen with family and friends. This was a problem the company decided to\ntackle in order to lead the streaming market.

This has made Netflix one of the\nmost successful software companies to date. How did Netflix do it?\nFirst, it focused the entire company around a solid vision. This vision has\nevolved over time as the market has evolved. Now the vision for Netflix is,\n\u201cBecoming the best global entertainment distribution service, licensing enter-\ntainment content around the world, creating markets that are accessible to film\nmakers, and helping content creators around the world to find a global audi-\nence.\u201d This vision states not only why the company exists but also the plan for\ngetting there. It aligns the team in the right direction.\nNetflix then self-organized around key outcomes and strategies to help reach\nits goals. Gibson Biddle, who was a VP of product at Netflix from 2005 to 2010,\ntalks about aligning his team around a common guideline for evaluating its prod-\nuct strategy. That guideline was to \u201cdelight customers, in margin-enhancing,\nhard-to-copy ways.\u201d He set goals that would accomplish this and would help Net-\nflix execute on the company vision around key initiatives (Table III-1), including\npersonalization, instant access to entertainment, and ease of use. Teams were\nthen able to explore tactics to accomplish these goals, and they were held\naccountable to success metrics for each.\n58 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\nTable III-1.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fb593ba-5d6f-4c73-ac16-4a0c4157bc68": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fb593ba-5d6f-4c73-ac16-4a0c4157bc68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Part III.

Netflix can change tactics or kill ideas because it com-\nmits itself not to the solutions they are building but rather to the outcomes these\nsolutions produce. The company then enforces this mentality with a product\nstrategy that is coherently aligned and decision enabling.\nThe powerful thing about a strategic framework like the one Netflix uses is\nthat it forces you to think about the whole before zooming in on the details.\nWhen we\u2019re developing software, we often think of the details and neglect the big\npicture. What feature can we build? How do we optimize that feature? When will\nit be delivered? When a company thinks only about the feature-level model, it\nloses track of the outcomes those features should produce. That is what lands\nyou in the build trap.\nIn Chapter 10, I cover the building blocks of strategy, starting from the big\npicture of the company vision and then continuing down through the company\nto the activities of the teams.

When done\nthis way, product management is successful. When leadership is not aligned at\nthe top, the issues trickle all the way down to the teams. The lack of meaning and\nfocus spreads, and, at the end of the year, the company will look at their target\ngoals and ask, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lack of leadership alignment is by far the big-\ngest issue I see standing in the way of successful product management.\nThe Effects Gap\nThe Effects Gap (Figure 11-3) is the difference between what we expect our\nactions to achieve and what actually happens. When organizations do not see the\nresults they want, they try to fill this gap by putting more controls in place. How-\never, that is the worst thing you can do in this scenario. Giving individuals and\nteams the freedom to adjust their actions so that they are in line with their goals\nis what will truly allow them to achieve results.\n68 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da1a8ace-6b5b-45b6-ac51-2d296c2b1fe4": {"__data__": {"id_": "da1a8ace-6b5b-45b6-ac51-2d296c2b1fe4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Autonomous Teams", "start_page_idx": 86, "end_page_idx": 88}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Figure 11-3. The Effects Gap, by Stephen Bungay from the Art of Action (reprinted by permission\nof Hodder & Stoughton)\nAll of these misguided, knee-jerk reactions start to pile up. Instead of align-\ning a team with a framework of goals and direction and then stepping back to\ngive that team the room to explore how to reach the goals, management usually\nswings a complete 180 degrees. It asks for more information. It expects teams to\ncommit to what management wants to do over the next year. It prescribes fully\nthought-out solutions, and then product teams are restricted to only those param-\neters instead of being able to focus on learning and adjusting their decisions as\nthey go.\nTo solve these various gaps and to deliver great products to your customers,\nyou need to view strategy in a different way, and, as Bungay proposes, enable\naction to achieve results. But why do we care about strategy being something that\nenables action? Well, that is how you scale an organization\u2014by enabling action\nthrough autonomous teams.\nAutonomous Teams\nAt Marquetly, the product managers were very frustrated by their lack of\nautonomy. One experienced product manager told me, \u201cI keep having leaders tell\nme to own the vision of my product, but I\u2019m not allowed. My manager keeps\nhanding me solutions. Every time I try to suggest something different, I\u2019m shut\ndown. When we went Agile, we were told that our Scrum teams were supposed\nto be autonomous. This is definitely not autonomy.\u201d\nSTRATEGIC GAPS | 69\n\nTalking to the leaders of Marquetly, I heard a different story. \u201cOur product\nmanagers won\u2019t step up and own the product. I have to keep prescribing things\nfor them, but it\u2019s because they don\u2019t take initiative.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an interesting dichotomy but a common one I\u2019ve seen in companies\nstuck in the build trap. These are all symptoms of not having a good strategy\nframework that enables action. When teams are not aligned with a clear direction\nand goals, they cannot effectively make decisions.

Those companies that are busy creating new visions\nand strategies every year often are thinking too much in the short term and aren\u2019t\nplanning enough for the future.\nMaybe you recognize this pattern. It\u2019s the same story every year. In Novem-\nber, the company goes into panic mode, running around like chickens with their\nheads cut off, trying to predict the future for the next year. Revenue, commit-\nments to shareholders, and budgets all get set. The laundry list of features that\nneed to be built piles up into detailed Gantt charts. And then January 1 hits, and\nthey get to work. They work on these things for a year, reach the arbitrary dead-\nline of December 31, and then stop to adopt their next strategy. Repeat this year\nafter year, and you leave no room to take on long-term projects or strategies.\nTying budgeting, strategy, and product development to this artificial yearly\ntime cycle only creates lack of focus and follow-through. Instead, companies\nshould be continuously evaluating where they are and where they need to take\naction, and then fund those decisions.\nThink of the major pieces of work you do that are actually bets. Henrik Kni-\nberg, a former consultant at Spotify, explains that this is how Spotify thinks.1 The\ncompany operates using something called DIBBs, which stands for Data,\nInsights, Beliefs, and Bets. The first three things, data, insight, and beliefs,\ninform a piece of work called a bet. The concept of thinking of initiatives as bets\nis powerful because it sets up a different type of expectation.\nSpotify maintains innovation by not establishing mandates about what to\nbuild from a higher-up perspective.

We call this\nact of communicating and aligning those narratives strategy deployment.\nJabe Bloom, the founder of consulting firm PraxisFlow, works with execu-\ntives to create and deploy strategies at large organizations. He explains why we\nshould think about different levels of strategies as stories at different time scales:\nAt different levels of organizations, we tell stories with different scales of\ntime (timespans), about our work and why we are doing it. In order for\npeople to act on the stories they hear, the stories can\u2019t have significantly\ndifferent time scales than they are accustomed to. Agile teams are really\ngood at telling two- to four-week stories. That\u2019s what they deal with on a\ndaily basis. As you go up in the organization, you tell stories with longer\ntimespans. Executives are really good at telling five-year stories, but a\nteam cannot act on a five-year story when they\u2019re used to thinking in two\nto four weeks. There\u2019s too much space to explore.\nStrategy deployment is about setting the right level of goals and objectives\nthroughout the organization to narrow the playing field so that teams can act. So,\nwhile executives might be looking at a five-year strategy, middle management is\nthinking in smaller strategies\u2014yearly or quarterly\u2014bounding the teams in a\ndirection that allows them to make decisions on a monthly or weekly basis.\nWhen teams are not sufficiently constrained, they become stuck. As Bloom\nexplains:\nThe unconstrained team is the most frightened and scared to act in the\norganization. They feel like they cannot make a decision because there are\ntoo many options. Appropriately constrained teams, ones who have a\ndirection set to the right level for them, feel safe to make decisions\nbecause they can see how their stories align to the goals and structure of\nthe organization.\nNot having the right level of direction lands us in the build trap. Teams are\ngiven instructions that are either too prescriptive or too broad. Executives will get\ntoo far into the weeds, managing by authority and not allowing autonomy.

I have seen companies try to cram the creation of a\nstrategy into that time frame and fail. This is something that takes time and\nfocus to craft and maintain.

For strategy to be created, you must first understand the\nvision, or where you want to go. Then we can identify problems or obstacles\nstanding in our way of getting there and experiment around tackling them. We\nrepeatedly do this until we reach the vision.\nThis is the basis of the continuous improvement framework practiced at \nToyota, called the Improvement Kata, which helped it determine its strategies.\nThe Kata teaches people in the company how to strategically tackle problems to\nreach goals.

Vision is not set solely top-\ndown by management. The entire organization should be sharing information as\nthey learn about what will reach goals, and help inform the strategy. Bloom calls\nthis Information Physics:\nOne of the biggest issues I hear from executives is that they do not have\nthe data they need to make decisions. People ask them to create a vision,\nbut they do not continuously surface information in a way that helps\ninform the strategic decisions that enable the organization to achieve the\nvision. The teams should be out there, analyzing, testing, and learning and\nthen communicating what they discover back to their peers and their\nmanagement teams. This is how we set strategy.\nThis process of communicating data and direction up and down\u2014and across\n\u2014the organization is how we maintain alignment.

On its website, Amazon notes that its company\nvision is, \u201cto be Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company, where customers can\nfind and discover anything they might want to buy online, and endeavors to offer\nits customers the lowest possible prices.\u201d\nThe company is made up of many different product lines, from its Prime\nVideo service to Fulfillment to Amazon. Each one of its products helps Amazon\nto achieve its overall vision, by creating a better experience for people who are\nshopping. By keeping an eye on the overall vision, the product people who test,\ndevelop, and grow these different products are able to make effective decisions\nabout what they should and shouldn\u2019t pursue.\nIf you are a single-product company, like Roku, this is easy because your\ncompany vision is very similar, if not the same, as your product vision. If you are\na large corporation, like Bank of America, it becomes complex. The strategy\nneeds to start at the corporate level, moving through the business lines, and ulti-\nmately arriving at the products. In these types of companies, products are just\ndetails on how the company vision is manifested. They are the vehicles for value\n\u2014the things you sell to customers, while receiving some form of value in return.\nHere the company vision is the wrapper that gives meaning to all of the products\nand services you offer.\n79\n| 13\n\nNow you might be thinking, \u201cWhat is the difference between a company\nmission and vision?\u201d A good mission explains why the company exists. A vision,\non the other hand, explains where the company is going based on that purpose. I\nfind that the best thing a company can do is to combine both the mission and the\nvision into one statement to provide the value proposition of the company\u2014what\nthe company does, why it does it, and how it wins doing that. Here are a few\nexamples of compelling vision statements:\nTo offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the way\nfor socially conscious businesses.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9fc6b322-1caa-46ed-bdce-fc2ca98abf7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9fc6b322-1caa-46ed-bdce-fc2ca98abf7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Company Vision", "start_page_idx": 96, "end_page_idx": 98}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Here are a few\nexamples of compelling vision statements:\nTo offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the way\nfor socially conscious businesses.\n\u2014WARBY PARKER\nAt Bank of America, we are guided by a common purpose to help make\nfinancial lives better by connecting clients and communities to the resour-\nces they need to be successful.\n\u2014BANK OF AMERICA\nBecoming the best global entertainment distribution service, licensing\nentertainment content around the world, creating markets that are acces-\nsible to film makers, and helping content creators around the world to find\na global audience.\n\u2014NETFLIX\nAll of these vision statements provide focus for the company. They are short,\nmemorable, and clearly articulated.

It\u2019s too broad. I don\u2019t want\nto get overprescriptive on the how here, but you do need to focus your company\naround where you want to concentrate.\nTake Netflix. Although it said it wanted to be the best global entertainment\ndistribution service, it provided focus on how the company planned to do that\u2014\nby licensing content around the world, creating markets that are accessible, and\nhelping content creators. It\u2019s okay to want to be the best or the market leader, but\nyou need to give some context on how.\nIf your vision has been murky for a while, you need to provide more than\njust a vision statement.

Although the vision is clear, the difficult part is\nconnecting it back to the company\u2019s operations. This is where it\u2019s necessary for\ncompany leaders to specify strategic intents. These few, concise, outcome-oriented\ngoals focus the company around how to reach the vision.\nStrategic Intents\nAlthough the vision should remain stable over a long period of time, how you\nintend to reach that vision changes as your company matures and develops. Stra-\ntegic intents communicate the company\u2019s current areas of focus that help realize\nthe vision. Strategic intents usually take a while to reach, on the magnitude of\none to several years.\nStrategic intents are always aligned to the current state of the business.\nWhen determining what these intents are, the C-Suite of the company should\nask, \u201cWhat is the most important thing we can do to reach our vision, based on\nwhere we are now?\u201d There should not be laundry list of desires or goals\u2014just a\nfew key things that need to happen to make a big leap forward. Keeping the list\nof strategic intents small focuses everyone.\nThis is where Marquetly, like many companies out there, struggled. Every\nyear, it would go into a yearly planning cycle to talk about the things the company\nwanted to do in the upcoming year.

Instead of dictating these solutions\ndown to the teams, leadership should have been focused on creating strategic\nintents. This approach would have aligned the decision making at the product\nlevel with the goals of the business and would have helped the company move\nsolidly in one direction. Instead, they were peanut buttering\u2014spreading them-\nselves thin over many areas of work instead of making a concerted push in one\ndirection.\nI held a strategy session for Marquetly\u2019s leaders to align on where they really\nwanted to go. To understand how to set our strategic intents, we had to first\nunderstand what business value really means. Joshua Arnold, a business and\nproduct consultant and expert on cost of delay, uses a great model for thinking\nabout business value,1 as shown in Figure 13-1.\nFigure 13-1.

This would\nallow Marquetly to sell licenses in bulk, producing more revenue and fostering\ngreater retention, as the few enterprises that already used Marquetly\u2019s product\ntended to renew annually. The company also realized that, to reach its revenue\ngoals, it would need to increase the revenue from individual users, as well. At\nthat point, its acquisition rates were not great. Management set these as the com-\npany\u2019s two strategic intents and associated the appropriate revenue goals around\nthem, as illustrated in Table 13-1.\nTable 13-1.

As Marquetly found out before, too many higher-level goals, and you are\nback to peanut buttering. I once saw a company with 5,000 people have 80 stra-\ntegic intents. With 5,000 people, they shipped only one feature per quarter\nbecause everyone was wildly distracted and working on too many things. One\nintent is usually good for a small company, and three are plenty for a large orga-\nnization. Yes, three. I know that sounds like very few goals for an organization of\nthousands of people, but that is key.

And no\none wants to watch TV on their tiny laptop screen all the time. First of all, you\u2019re\nbasically saying that no one can watch it with you.

They built products for the past dec-\nade and have reached a point at which they can no longer scale. All of them have\nthe same problem: too many products and no coherent vision. They were build-\ning one-off products to satisfy individual customer requests, but they failed to\naddress a wider audience. Or they built products that helped them move into new\nmarkets but did not figure out how these new products reconciled with their\nexisting offerings. Many of these companies are ridiculously successful\u2014they\nmake over a billion dollars a year\u2014but they are bogged down with too many peo-\nple, little direction, and no holistic approach, making it difficult to keep growing.\nAlthough having a strategy usually helps these companies align and focus\ntheir work, it also reveals a bigger issue: the lack of an overall product vision.\nEven though having multiple features and ways to deliver value is a good thing,\nwe need something to tie it all together at the top.\nThe product vision communicates why you are building something and what\nthe value proposition is for the customer. Amazon does this particularly well by\ncreating what they call Press Release documents for every product vision. These\nshort (typically a page or two) notices describe the problem the user is facing and\nhow the solution enables the user to solve that problem.\nThe product vision emerges from experimentation around solving problems\nfor users. After you validate that the solution is the right one, you can grow it into\na scalable, maintainable product. But you need to be careful not to make the\nproduct vision too specific. It cannot describe every little feature but should\ninclude more of the main capabilities it enables for the user. If you are too pre-\nscriptive, it could stifle the way you grow the product and what you might add to\nit later.\nAt Marquetly, the company was formulating the product vision for their\nproducts.

This is the build trap. You\ncan get out of the build trap by understanding and applying problem-solving and\nexperimentation techniques like Marquetly\u2019s team did here to find what it should\nfocus on.

To do this, you need to under-\nstand the strategic intent, evaluate the current state of that strategic intent in rela-\ntion to where your products can help, and determine what problems you can\nsolve to further that strategic intent. This is what Marquetly did during its\nresearch and analysis to arrive at the product initiatives of increasing content and\nbuilding out a more robust assessment.\nThere can be many options that help reach the product initiative, as we saw\nwith the three we had to produce more content at Marquetly. One or all of these\nmight be what it takes to get us to the successful outcome of the initiative, and\nthat\u2019s okay. To determine whether we are getting closer to achieving our product\ninitiative, we need to break the success metrics into something we can measure\non a shorter time scale. We call this the team goal, and it\u2019s how we measure the\nsuccess of the option. Although it can take six months or longer to reach the\nproduct initiative goal, the team goal should be something we can measure after\nevery release, which gives us feedback that our option is working the way we\nwant it to. We set the team goal with the same process as we did for the product\ninitiative.\nContext Matters\nSince Lean Startup emerged on the scene, experimentation has been a hot button\ntopic in many software companies.

It\u2019s important to take\na step back and understand where you are and what is needed in that stage\nbefore you jump into any work. This is where the Product Kata helps.\nAfter we have set the goal, we begin walking through the Product Kata. We\nask ourselves the following:\n1. What is the goal?\n2. Where are we now in relation to that goal?\n3. What is the biggest problem or obstacle standing in the way of me reach-\ning that goal?\n4. How do I try to solve that problem?\n5.

These questions\ntake us through the problem exploration, solution exploration, and solution opti-\nmization phases. The steps we choose to take and the tools we implement to do\nso will change, depending on where we are.\nIt\u2019s important to understand each phase so that we are doing just enough to\nget us to the goal. One of the biggest mistakes I\u2019ve seen in product management\nis teams rushing in to apply a tool or practice at the wrong stage. Many times,\nthey are experimenting unnecessarily when the problem is not yet known or\nwhen there is already a good idea about the solution.\nWhen considering whether to experiment around a particular solution, I\nthink of what my friend Brian Kalma, former head of UX for Zappos, once told\nme: \u201cDon\u2019t spend your time overdesigning and creating unique, innovative solu-\ntions for things that are not core to your value proposition. If someone has\nalready solved that problem with a best practice, learn from that, implement their\nsolutions, gather data to determine if it\u2019s successful in your situation, and then\niterate. Reserve your time and energy for the things that will make or break your\nvalue proposition.\u201d\nA good example of this is a checkout page on an e-commerce website. If you\ndon\u2019t want to get into the business of being a checkout service for other e-\ncommerce companies, don\u2019t spend all your time here. There\u2019s lots of experimen-\ntation that has already happened around this particular solution, and you can\nharness that. I should know. I researched this heavily when I worked at an when\nI worked at an e-commerce company. If you can, learn from those who have opti-\nmized already, implement their best practices, and tweak from there. When\nthat\u2019s not an option, you have a chance to explore adjacent areas or to chart your\nown path.\nWhen the problem that you are solving is core to your value proposition, take\na step back and don\u2019t rush into the first solution.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "143666c5-3323-462c-8303-e52cf5848f12": {"__data__": {"id_": "143666c5-3323-462c-8303-e52cf5848f12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Context Matters", "start_page_idx": 115, "end_page_idx": 118}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "When the problem that you are solving is core to your value proposition, take\na step back and don\u2019t rush into the first solution.

Keeping a pulse on your prod-\nuct is crucial for knowing when you should act and where. This is how we set\ndirection.\nBut it\u2019s easy to become stuck measuring the wrong things. Frequently, teams\nturn to measuring what we call vanity metrics. This concept, introduced in Lean\nStartup, is about goals that look shiny and impressive because they always get\nbigger. People are excited to share how many users are on their product, how\nmany daily page views they have, or how many logins their system has.

Consider the meaning behind the metrics and how they help\ninform your decisions and understanding.\nIn addition to vanity metrics, I often see product teams measuring output-\noriented metrics, such as the number of features shipped, story points complete,\nor user stories worked on. Although these are good productivity metrics, they are\nnot product metrics. They cannot tie the results of product development back to\nthe business. So we need to a set of metrics that can help us do that.\nThere are many product frameworks available to help you think through the\nappropriate product goals. My two favorites are Pirate Metrics and HEART met-\nrics.\nPirate Metrics\nPirate Metrics were created by Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups, to talk\nabout the life cycle of users through your product. Think of it as a funnel\n(Figure 16-1): users finding your product is acquisition; users having a great first\nexperience is activation; keeping users returning to your product is called reten-\ntion; users recommending others because they love your product is referral; and,\nfinally, users paying for your product because they see value in it is revenue.

Acquisition is that users land on your site\nand sign up. This is what they were measuring at Marquetly. Activation is when\nsomeone takes the first step with your product toward having a great experience.\nFor Marquetly, that would be taking the assessment so that they understand\nwhich courses to take. Activating people well at the beginning leads to retention\ndown the line.\nNow not every company has the same path to monetizing users. This path\nworks for consumer products with a freemium attribute. If you are a B2B product\nwith a sales team, you generate revenue before users have activation. You can\nswap the order of these to match your product\u2019s flow.\nWith the right funnel, you can easily calculate the conversion through each\nstep. This informs you as to where people are tending to fall off and allows you to\nact to fix it. Understanding how many people are in each phase of the funnel also\nlets you target those cohorts and figure out how to move them into the next one.\nThe goal here is to keep people retained and paying.\nAlthough Pirate Metrics became very popular, some people saw the flaw that\nit did not talk about user satisfaction. Kerry Rodden, a Googler, created the\nHEART metrics to account for this.\nThe HEART Framework\nHEART metrics measure happiness, engagement, adoption, retention, and task suc-\ncess. These are usually used to talk about a specific product or feature. Here,\nadoption is similar to activation in Pirate Metrics because you are talking about\nsomeone using the product for the first time. Retention is the same as in Pirate\nMetrics.\nWith HEART, you add in other metrics to talk about how the user interacts\nwith the product. Happiness is a measure of how satisfied the user is with the\nproduct. Engagement is a measure of how often users interact with the product.\nTask success measures how easy it is for a user to accomplish what they were\nmeant to with the product.\nYou can learn more about HEART metrics in Rodden\u2019s article, \u201cHow to\nChoose the Right UX Metrics for Your Product.\u201d1\n106 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "739c69d4-6cf9-4cb7-93a1-3c14368783e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "739c69d4-6cf9-4cb7-93a1-3c14368783e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Setting Direction with Data", "start_page_idx": 124, "end_page_idx": 126}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Setting Direction with Data\nAs I mentioned before, all product-related activities contribute to revenue or cost,\nat the end of the day, for the business. This is how we connect product metrics to\nbusiness outcomes. But it\u2019s important to have metrics at every level of strategy,\nincluding the product initiative and option, so we can tell whether we are suc-\ncessful along the way.\nWhatever your metric, it\u2019s important to have a system of metrics, not just\none, to guide product decisions. It\u2019s easy to game one metric when it\u2019s your sin-\ngular focus. Marquetly could have easily fallen into this trap, as well. Whatever\noptions it explores to increase acquisition, it should be sure to keep watching the\nretention rate of those users and should make sure it doesn\u2019t fall below a certain\nthreshold. I call the system of two metrics that balance out each other mutually\ndestructive pairs, although there can be more than just two.\nThere is one issue with this system, though. Retention is a lagging indicator,\nwhich is impossible to act on immediately. It will be months before you have\nsolid data to show that people stayed with you. That is why we also need to meas-\nure leading indicators like activation, happiness, and engagement. Leading indi-\ncators tell us whether we\u2019re on our way to achieving those lagging indicators like\nretention. To determine the leading indicators for retention, you can qualify what\nkeeps people retained\u2014for example, happiness and usage of the product.\nUsually, the success metrics we set around options are leading indicators of\noutcomes we expect on our initiatives, because options are strategies on a shorter\ntime scale, as we talked about in the previous chapter. The success metrics need\nto be commensurate with the length of the bet there. Measuring the metrics at\nyour option level helps to prevent surprises when the cold, hard facts come in\nlater at the initiative level.\nTo make sure you have enough data to act on, it\u2019s important to implement\ntools that make it easy to measure these things.

User\nresearch, in this case, is not to be mistaken for usability testing, which involves\nshowing a prototype or website and directing people to complete actions. There,\nyou are learning whether they can use and navigate the solution easily, not\nwhether the solution actually solves a problem. This type of research is called\nevaluative.\nProblem-based user research is generative research, meaning that its purpose\nis to find the problem you want to solve. It involves going to the source of the\ncustomer\u2019s problem and understanding the context around it. This is what Mar-\nquetly did.

For\nthe first and third use case, we might create a UI with which they can choose cer-\ntain metrics to monitor and have them update over a time period.

I got to work trying to assess where they were in the\nprocess and which problem they were solving. Where did this idea for an app\ncome from? After some digging and talking to key people, I discovered that the\ncompany had launched an entirely different app the year before and had a very\nsuccessful download rate. More people were coming to the site, and it really was\na boon for acquisition.\nThe company was convinced it would get a lot of customer business from\nthis new app, as well, but no one was able to determine whether the problem\nthey were solving was the right one. The company had rushed into building fea-\ntures for the sake of getting something out the door rather than trying to under-\nstand what its customers wanted and needed.\nOn my first day, I met with the product and leadership teams to dig deeper\ninto their idea for the new app. This time around, they wanted to use a Tinder-\nlike interface to match women up with potential business mentors. The hypothe-\nsis was that women needed access to mentors quickly to help with career advice\nand advancement, and they were willing to connect with other women in their\ncities to meet that need. The teams put a lot of weight in that hypothesis. But we\ndecided to take a step back and ask the glaring question: \u201cDo women feel com-\nfortable connecting with strangers for mentorship in this manner?\u201d\nWe tested that assumption.

In these situations, you need to get crea-\ntive. A friend of mine, Chris Matts, is a master of navigating company con-\nstraints. He once told me about how he was working at a company and was told\nhe could not talk to the customers. He went to the person who set the rule, who\nthen sent him to another person who had apparently set the rule. He kept going\nup and up the chain until finally getting to the person who really had issued the\nedict. This person looked at him and said, \u201cWhat? I never said people couldn\u2019t\ntalk to those customers. I just said you had to go through a specific process to do\nit. Just fill out this form.\u201d The next day, he was talking to customers.\nLearning some information is better than none.

This is why experimenting to learn was key.\nCompanies often confuse the building to learn and building to earn. Experi-\nmentation is all about building to learn. It allows you to understand your custom-\ners better and to prove whether there is value in solving a problem. Experiments\nshould not be designed to last for a long time. By nature, they are meant to prove\nwhether a hypothesis is true or false, and, in software, we want to do this as\nquickly as possible. This means you\u2019ll need to eventually scrap whatever you\nbuild and figure out how to make it sustainable and scalable, if it does succeed.\nSince The Lean Startup was published, companies have been adopting experi-\nmentation techniques, yet many of them have done so for the wrong reasons.\nThey all are trying to build the ideal Minimum Viable Product (MVP), an experi-\nmentation concept introduced in the book. I asked my Twitter followers how they\ndefined an MVP at their company. A bunch of people replied, but one follower\nsummed it up well: \u201cI was told by two separate clients that whatever is built in\nthe first release is an MVP.\u201d\nThis type of thinking is exactly what lands us in the build trap. When we use\nan MVP only to get a feature out quicker, we\u2019re usually cutting corners on a great\nexperience in the process. Thus, we sacrifice the amount we can learn from it.\nThe most important piece of the MVP is the learning, which is why my definition\nhas always been \u201cthe minimum amount of effort to learn.\u201d This keeps us anch-\nored on outcomes rather than outputs.\nDue to the misconception of this term, I have stopped using MVP altogether.\nInstead, I talk more about solution experimentation.

Communication is key to a successful\nexperimentation process.\nCONCIERGE\nThe experiment that Marquetly ran with its teachers is called a concierge experi-\nment. Concierge experiments deliver the end result to your client manually, but\nthey do not look like the final solution at all. Your customers will understand that\nyou\u2019re doing it manually and that it\u2019s not automated. It\u2019s one of my favorite\nexperiment types because it doesn\u2019t involve coding and it\u2019s quick to get started.\nBecause you get to work with your customers closely, there is a ton of feedback\nflowing through and there are tight learning loops.\nConcierge experiments are particularly interesting for B2B companies\nbecause this is how many of these companies got started\u2014by taking on the work\nfor the customers and then later automating it. By taking on the work yourself,\nyou can learn how to build the software correctly the first time. And it\u2019s far faster\nand less expensive to iterate on a service than on a coded feature. I frequently\nused this type of experiment to learn about my customers when I worked as a\nproduct manager.\nAt an SEO company, we used Excel to model a forecasting tool to predict\nwhere organizations\u2019 keywords would rank. We were able to deliver the spread-\nsheet manually to a few clients and gauge their response. We learned what types\nof factors they were most interested in controlling and what percentage of cer-\ntainty made them feel comfortable. After a month of using spreadsheets, we were\nable to code the feature into our product and to launch to our user base with wide\nsuccess.\nConcierge experimenting can be a very powerful tool. The thing to note with\nthis method is that it does not scale, given that it\u2019s labor intensive. You should\nconduct these experiments with just enough users so that you can stay in regular\ncontact with them, get plenty of feedback, and then use that information to iter-\nate. As Marquetly did, you can calculate how many people you can handle over a\ncertain period of time.

When you are ready to see whether your solution scales to\nmore people, you should use another type of experiment.\nWIZARD OF OZ\nThe method I suggest for reaching a broader audience for feedback is called the\nWizard of Oz. The idea behind the Wizard of Oz is that, unlike the concierge\n122 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\nexperiment, it looks and feels like a real, finished product. Customers don\u2019t know\nthat, on the backend, it\u2019s all manual. Someone is pulling the strings\u2014just like\nthe Wizard of Oz.\nZappos actually started with this Wizard of Oz method. Back in the day,\nfounder Nick Swinmurn wanted to see whether people would really buy shoes\nonline. He put a simple website up on WordPress. Visitors could view and then\nbuy the shoes online. But, on the backend, it was just Nick, singlehandedly run-\nning around, buying shoes from Sears and shipping them out from UPS him-\nself, as each order came in. There was no infrastructure, no inventory of shoes,\nno person manning the phones. It was simply a page where the founder waited\nfor orders. As soon as the orders came in, he went and fulfilled them. Through\nthis approach, he validated that there was demand for buying shoes online\nwithout building out the entire site. That\u2019s the Wizard of Oz method.\nThis is a great technique, when you are looking for feedback at scale. We\nused this to prove a hypothesis around subscriptions at an e-commerce company\nwhere I worked. The head of operations had a great idea on how to sell more of\nour existing products. This was right around the time when Amazon imple-\nmented its one-click subscription services, and he saw that it could apply to us, as\nwell. We had many products on our site that required people to reorder them\nevery month\u2014protein powder, vitamins, and supplements, for example.\nHe came to me with the idea and asked us to explore how much effort it\nwould be to implement.

It looked like a normal subscription product\nto the customers, but, on the back end, the customer service team would pull the\norders on those products and reorder it for people every month. We kept track of\nthose sales for four months and found that many people would cancel their sub-\nscriptions in the second or third month. That was strange. I mean, if they wanted\nto keep using the product, they would need to reorder it.\nI called some of the people to find out. There was one common problem.\nThey said, \u201cI want to feel like I have control over my purchases. I subscribe to too\nmany things now.

This is not wise, because it is still\nmanual on the backend. After you know which direction you want to go in, you\ncan begin to think about the full solution or move on to other forms of experi-\nmentation.\nWizard of Oz can also be combined with techniques such as A/B testing. In\nA/B testing, you split a portion of your traffic to a new solution idea to see\nwhether it moves a metric compared to the current state of the site. You can use\nthis outside of Wizard of Oz, as well, to test new designs or messages on your\nwebsite.\nBut you need to be careful about when you use A/B testing. You wouldn\u2019t\nwant to use A/B testing in two instances: if you were still very unsure about your\nsolution direction or if you did not have enough traffic to those pages for the\nresults to have statistical significance. If the latter, you could use techniques like\nconcept testing to get feedback.\nCONCEPT TESTING\nConcept testing is another solution experiment that focuses more on high-touch\ninteraction with the customer. In this case, you try to demonstrate or show con-\ncepts to the user to gauge their feedback. These can vary in execution, from land-\ning pages and low-fidelity wireframes to higher-fidelity prototypes or videos of\nhow the service might play out. The idea here is to pitch the solution idea in the\nfastest, lightest way possible to convey the message.\nIt\u2019s important to note that this type of experiment tends to be more genera-\ntive than evaluative. Just like problem research, generative solution experiments\nhelp you to gain more awareness around what a user desires in a solution.

When it explained how Dropbox worked, the investors\ndismissed it, citing a crowded market of similar tools. No matter how hard they\ntried to explain the solution, the investors just couldn\u2019t picture it.\nSo, the company turned to a solution experiment. The team put together a\nrough video, demonstrating what Dropbox could do. It had not built a demo or a\nprototype but instead used video editing to demonstrate what it would look and\nfeel like to the investors. It felt like a real product demo, even though it wasn\u2019t a\nfinished product. When the investors saw it, they went wild. To them, it was\nmagic.

It\nis important to remember that these tools are used for higher amounts of uncer-\ntainty and, thus, larger risk in your solution ideas.\nFor example, I worked with one team that was experimenting around how to\nreduce the amount of calls to a help desk at its office.

When you need to learn\nwhether a specific user flow or feature solves a problem for the user and allows\nthem to achieve their desired outcome, you can turn to prototypes. It is an excel-\nlent tool because prototypes don\u2019t require any code, and there are many software\nproducts out there that can help you link screens together to make the flow feel\nreal.\nBut, if you don\u2019t go the design sprint route when creating your prototype,\nwhich includes heavy user research before diving into design, you can easily\nbecome stuck trying to solve a problem you don\u2019t yet understand.

The GiveVision mission was to help\nsight-impaired people \u201csee\u201d by providing glasses that would read, recognize, and\nreport on what was going on in the world around them.

The organization had to program the software with a third-party\nmanufacturer and couldn\u2019t iterate on it afterward because it was hardcoded into\nthe glasses and couldn\u2019t be updated after it was installed. I talked to founders\nabout the concept of risk and how the company might mitigate it with experi-\nmentation. The founder said that the biggest risk was that there were so many\noptions for what could be programmed into the glasses and no one was sure\nwhich ones were the highest value items. That\u2019s when the company decided to\nexperiment.\nWhen I came back a month later, I was astounded by the progress the group\nhad made.

A lot of the confusion was around a slightly complicated\nuser experience in the software, but, with minimal help, the teachers were able to\nnavigate it. The team made a note that, if it did acquire the software, it would\nneed to redesign some elements of the interface.\nAfter three weeks, the team began to see the courses being posted.

This is\nwhat I have:\n\u2022 \u201cAdopted by 75% of our teachers currently creating or starting courses\nwithin one month.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cPublished course rate increases from 25% to at least 60%.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cTime to create a new course decreases from three months to less than\none month.\u201d\n\u201cRich, can you make sure we can measure these things for the first release?\u201d\nasked Christa.\n\u201cSure,\u201d Rich responded. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure analytics are set up so we can keep\ntracking these things as we go.\u201d\n\u201cGreat,\u201d said Christa. \u201cI\u2019ll work with the teacher-outreach and marketing\nteams to create communication on how we will inform our teachers and train\nthem in the new product.\u201d\nAs the team built the functionality, Matt would test screens with a few select\nteachers to make sure they could navigate it with their own content. They iterated\nalong the way, until the day came for the first release.\nFeeling confident, the team launched its new video-editing capabilities to the\nteachers and waited to see how they were received. Within one week, they could\nsee the adoption of the features begin to increase. They reached out to the teach-\ners periodically to see how they were receiving the new capabilities. There were a\nfew issues that they prioritized in the next release, but things seemed to be going\nsmoothly.\nAfter a month, Christa pulled the numbers to compare to the team\u2019s success\nmetrics.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "567a34d2-2a51-4bab-89da-3a88b7d797dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "567a34d2-2a51-4bab-89da-3a88b7d797dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Chapter 19.

Keep doing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\nThe team worked to keep iterating on its new video-editing functionality\nuntil it reached its goals. After a few months, the results were speaking for them-\nselves. A 75% publish rate, happier teachers, and an increased number of pub-\nlished second courses all spoke to the success.\nEvolving the Product Vision\nChrista\u2019s team was able to find a scalable, successful solution by iterating its way\nto a product vision. As I mentioned in the strategy section, it evolved through\nexperimentation. Had the team jumped into dictating features early on, it might\nnever have found the right solution for its customers. The team probably would\nhave still been stuck on redesigning the course creation workflow, which it later\nproved was not the biggest problem.\nAfter the direction is set for the product vision, it\u2019s important to make sure\neveryone understands the context and work that needs to be done. Story mapping\nand North Star documents are two ways to help teams find alignment around the\nvision.\nA North Star document explains the product in a way that can be visualized\nby the entire team and company. This includes the problem it is solving, the pro-\nposed solution, the solution factors that matter for success, and the outcomes the\nproduct will result in.\nNorth Stars are great for providing context to a wide audience. They should\nbe evolved over time, as you learn more about your product. It\u2019s important to\nnote that this is not an action plan\u2014it does not include how the team will be\nbuilding the product. That is where story mapping comes in.\nStory mapping helps teams break down their work and align around goals. As\nPatton says, \u201cIts purpose is to help the team communicate about their work and\nwhat needs to get done to deliver value.\u201d Christa\u2019s team used story mapping to\nthink through all the factors needed to deliver a successful solution.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "334bb39e-8c4f-4e68-9941-c2934b0b8258": {"__data__": {"id_": "334bb39e-8c4f-4e68-9941-c2934b0b8258", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Evolving the Product Vision", "start_page_idx": 153, "end_page_idx": 154}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This\nincluded breaking down each desired action from the user standpoint.\nBuilding understanding as a team helps you develop product faster, which\nmeans getting value out to the customers faster.

You need to always start at that big\npicture\u2014the North Star\u2014to do this well, though. Otherwise, there is nothing to\nanchor you, and you end up leading yourself into the build trap.\nPrioritizing Work\nTo get to a Version 1, you need to prioritize your work. Prioritization, as I men-\ntioned earlier, is a top issue for most product managers. There are many frame-\nworks out there that will help you prioritize, like benefits mapping, Kano models,\nand others, but my favorite is Cost of Delay. If you understand the desired out-\ncomes from a strategic perspective, you can use Cost of Delay to help you deter-\nmine what to ship sooner.\nIn his book, The Principles of Product Development Flow, Don Reinertsen talks\nabout the importance of Cost of Delay in prioritizing work. He calls it \u201cthe one\nthing\u201d that should be quantified. Cost of Delay is a numeric value that describes\nthe impact of time on the outcomes you hope to achieve. It combines urgency\nand value so that you can measure impact and prioritize what you should be\ndoing first.\nWhen you think of building and releasing that first version of the product,\nyou need to consider the trade-offs between the amount of value you can capture\nwith the scope of the release and the time it takes to get it out the door. It\u2019s an\noptimization problem. You want to reduce scope enough so that you can capture\nthe maximum value in the right time.\nIf you wait too long because you overscoped the release, you lose the money\nyou could have been making. Worse, a competitor could swoop in and steal your\nmarket. Then you\u2019d have a higher threshold to entry, and your product will need\nto be light years better than the competition\u2019s. On the flip side, you don\u2019t want to\nrelease something that is terrible and provides minimal benefit to the user in\norder to get it out early. Then you could lose early adopters, and it\u2019s difficult to\nwin someone back after they\u2019ve had a terrible experience.\nChrista\u2019s team discussed the Cost of Delay involved with shipping the third-\nparty video feature in their first version.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "502d3538-17e1-44be-8854-c024a7355502": {"__data__": {"id_": "502d3538-17e1-44be-8854-c024a7355502", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Prioritizing Work", "start_page_idx": 154, "end_page_idx": 156}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Then you could lose early adopters, and it\u2019s difficult to\nwin someone back after they\u2019ve had a terrible experience.\nChrista\u2019s team discussed the Cost of Delay involved with shipping the third-\nparty video feature in their first version. It decided that, because it wasn\u2019t a criti-\ncal component for a large number of users, and it would take another month to\ncode that part of the product, the product should not include it. Shipping faster\nwas ideal since every week the company delayed meant a course that wouldn\u2019t be\npublished.\nBUILDING AND OPTIMIZING YOUR SOLUTION | 137\n\nYou might be thinking, \u201cBut how do I calculate the revenue for each of my\nproducts?\u201d Ozlem Yuce and Joshua J. Arnold are the experts in Cost of Delay,\nand they have created a qualitative way to assess it, as illustrated in Figure 19-1.\nFigure 19-1. Qualitative cost of delay, by Joshua Arnold and Ozlem Yuce (reprinted by permis-\nsion of Joshua Arnold and Ozlem Yuce)\nIn this situation, you would discuss each feature or feature component in\nterms of urgency and value. If it is high urgency, that means that every moment\nyou do not ship that feature to customers, you are losing out on opportunity to\nhit your goal\u2014for example, if you are actively losing customers or revenue each\nweek because you are not fulfilling a need. High value is about solving the stron-\ngest problems or desires for the customer.\nIn Marquetly\u2019s case, the features that were highest in urgency and value were\nadding the audio and splicing the content with images. These were two critical\ncomponents for their solution and were prioritized first. The rest fell near the\nhigher end of this matrix, except for video splicing. This was only utilized by a\nfew teachers, and great videos could still be created without it. Thus, the urgency\nand value were a bit lower, and it was not prioritized for the first release.\n138 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3ea5915-6080-4edd-91dc-edbaf3bcb7ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3ea5915-6080-4edd-91dc-edbaf3bcb7ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "The Real Definition of Done", "start_page_idx": 156, "end_page_idx": 158}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1 Dhaval Panchal, \u201cWhat is Definition of Done (DoD)?\u201d, http://bit.ly/2Rjgh2i.\nCost of Delay can help end many debates about what should and should not\nbe prioritized first. If you want to learn more, head to Black Swan Farming and\nread about how to utilize the concept in your company.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that, after you ship the first version, though, you\nare not technically done. You still need to reach your goals. This is where the\nDefinition of Done comes into play.\nThe Real Definition of Done\nIn Agile development, there is a concept called the Definition of Done. It is\ndefined by the Scrum Alliance as a \u201cchecklist of valuable activities required to\nproduce software.\u201d1 When teams create their Definition of Done, it\u2019s usually\naround finishing building features required to ship a product. Although this is\ndefinitely a useful concept to make sure the team finished what it needs to, it sets\nthe wrong expectation about what a finished feature is.\nWe are done developing or iterating on a feature only when it has reached its\ngoals. Often, teams ship a first version of the feature and then move on to the\nnext, without measuring the outcomes for the user. As Jeff Gothelf, the author of\nSense & Respond, once said, \u201cVersion 2 is the biggest lie in software develop-\nment.\u201d This mentality always leads to the build trap.\nInstead, teams should be working like the team at Marquetly, by setting the\nsuccess criteria before launch, while measuring and iterating until they reach it.\nVersion 1 should be looked at as a hypothesis, just like any other work. And, if we\nlaunch the feature and it is not hitting our goals, we need to be comfortable roll-\ning it back and trying something else.\nWhen you have success criteria set for the launch, you can use them in the\nProduct Kata and repeat the steps we went through in this section: set the direc-\ntion with your success criteria, understand what problems are standing in the\nway of you reaching it, and systematically tackle them through experimentation.\nNo matter whether you are building a new feature or optimizing one, the\nprocess is the same.

You should\nreally be looking at how to integrate your camera technology into phones.\u201d All\nnine of our heads bobbed eagerly, as we made our case to the Kodak team. It was\n2008, and a big shift in digital photography was in motion. Many of you know\nwhat came next for Kodak\u2014it\u2019s a well-documented tale of disruption. Well, I was\nactually there for it and witnessed firsthand what happens when an organization\ndoes not plan for innovation.\nOne year earlier, I had been chosen to participate on an innovation team at\nCornell University that was partnering with Kodak Research Laboratories to cre-\nate a new product that would appeal to people in their early 20s. Kodak Research\nLaboratories was responsible for researching breakthrough innovations in the\narea of imaging. Our fearless leaders at Cornell were experimenting with a new\nway of creating products, in which talking to customers and validating problems\npreceded any building activity. Kodak was ready for the challenge.\nA few months before the project kickoff on January 9, 2007, Steve Jobs had\nannounced the first iPhone. Even though everyone was going absolutely nuts\nover having the internet on their phone, Kodak was focused on the internet and\ncameras on one device. This was a dangerous combination for its business, as\nsigns were already pointing to disruption. A few years earlier, digital cameras had\nstill been a bit of a novelty. You could tote them around to document every gath-\nering or shenanigan. With the launch of the iPhone, however, we all began leav-\ning our bulky digital cameras at home and using phones as cameras. It was more\nconvenient, and the phones could immediately upload images to Facebook. The\nmarket for digital and film-based cameras, core businesses for Kodak, was\nshrinking.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7831bc26-ca68-4417-9e81-e80befc15044": {"__data__": {"id_": "7831bc26-ca68-4417-9e81-e80befc15044", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Part V.

The\nmarket for digital and film-based cameras, core businesses for Kodak, was\nshrinking.\nIt was an innovate-or-die situation, and unbeknown to us at the time, my\nteam was at the center of it. Our mission was to find the intersection of what the\nmarket really wanted and what Kodak could create. Because we were isolated\nfrom the rest of the company, our innovation lab had no roadblocks to prevent us\nfrom thinking big. We could fully pursue this mission without worrying about\nbureaucracy or management shooting down our ideas. But it also kept us in the\ndark about other areas of Kodak. We were unaware of how, if at all, our work fit\ninto the overall company strategy.\nWe were targeting people in their late teens and early twenties because they\nwere readily adopting new technology faster than other age groups. Instant mes-\nsaging and Facebook were leading the charge, and college-aged students were\n142 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\ngobbling it all up like Thanksgiving dinner. We saw an opportunity to solve\nunmet needs, given that these technologies were so new.\nMarket-driven innovation was the term we coined to explain our process. Over\nthe next few months, we interviewed users in this age group, all while looking for\nopportunities for Kodak to innovate. We were particularly interested in how our\ntarget market balanced real-life interactions with the social capabilities of the new\ntechnologies. We organized research groups and held one-on-one conversations\nto understand the behavioral patterns, the concerns, and the needs. We\nimmersed ourselves in their problems.\nTrends began to emerge quickly in our interviews. Although our target user\ngroup was generally obsessed with sharing information on Facebook, there was\ngrowing concern around who could actually see this information. Technology\nwas rapidly evolving, and the consequences\u2014how that would affect real life\u2014\nwere still unknown. Would employers see my drunken Saturday night where I\nfell over a parked car?

Feeling\npretty confident about our findings, we presented them to the management\nteam.\n\u201cYou should really be looking at how to integrate your camera technology\ninto phones,\u201d we told them. We went on to explain that the company should\nexplore photo editing. Kodak already had editing software on desktop computers,\nbut we suggested enabling simple photo editing directly on the phone itself. We\nthought that would blow people\u2019s minds. Add in the ability to immediately share\nphotos, and you\u2019re looking at a huge opportunity. People could geotag their pho-\ntos with locations, organize them appropriately, and control who could see them.\nWe then proposed that Kodak move forward in one of two ways\u2014build its\nown phones and compete with Apple and BlackBerry, or simply provide the tech-\nnology directly to the already-established phone manufacturers.

Cell phone cameras are so high tech now that\nno one uses digital cameras anymore. You can geotag your images, and you have\ncontrol over who sees what posts.

By isolating a small team in an innovation lab, it also\ndidn\u2019t dedicate enough people to thinking about the future of the business.\nEven though our team was practicing the discovery process of product man-\nagement with the right approach, we were in a silo, separated out into an innova-\ntion center without the proper resources to fully execute on what we were\ndiscovering. Kodak had to secure a new budget to put any of our plans in action,\nsomething it couldn\u2019t do for another six months during its annual review. Its phi-\nlosophy as an organization was not set up to succeed in the world of rapid inno-\nvation that emerged during the early 2000s.\nMany companies are in danger of becoming just like Kodak, but this fate can\nbe avoided by adopting a product-led mindset. Throughout this book, I\u2019ve laid out\nwhat is necessary for a good product management practice. We\u2019ve talked about\nthe importance of having the right roles with the right people in them and then\nsupporting them with a good product strategy. We then dove deep into how the\nproduct management process can uncover the opportunities to achieve that strat-\negy.\nHowever, these processes alone are not enough to get you out of the build\ntrap. As we saw with Kodak, you can be making an effort to understand your cus-\ntomers and to conduct good research, but, without the organization to sustain it,\nthe efforts are too little, too late.

Those attributes were starting to fade and were being replaced by a\ncustomer-centric and outcome-oriented mindset.

Lead-\ners will say that they want to achieve results, but, at the end of the day, they still\nmeasure success by features shipped. Why?

When leaders do not see progress toward goals, they quickly resort to\ntheir old ways.\nWe need a cadence of communicating strategy that matches our strategic\nframework. Remember our four levels of strategy: vision, strategic intent, prod-\nuct initiatives, and options. Each of these is on a different time horizon, and pro-\ngress toward them should be communicated accordingly.\nMost companies I\u2019ve worked with have a few core meetings to evaluate pro-\ngress and to make strategic decisions from a product level:\n\u2022 Quarterly business reviews\n\u2022 Product initiative reviews\n\u2022 Release reviews\nDuring quarterly business review meetings, the senior leadership team, made\nup of the executives and the highest level of the organization, should be discus-\nsing progress toward the strategic intents and outcomes of a financial nature.\nThis includes reviewing revenue for the quarter, churn of customers, and costs\nassociated with development or operations. The chief product officer (CPO) and\ntheir VPs of product are responsible for communicating how the outcomes of\nproduct initiatives have furthered strategic intents, like Karen did at Marquetly.\nNew strategic intents can be introduced in this meeting, as older ones are com-\ning to completion. It is not a place to prioritize new product initiatives or to go\ninto detail on them. That is what the product initiative review is for.\nThe product initiative review is another quarterly meeting that can be stag-\ngered with the quarterly business review on off months. This meeting is for the\nproduct development side of the house\u2014CPO, CTO, design leaders, the VPs of\nproduct, and the product managers. Here we review the progress of the options\nagainst the product initiatives and adjust our strategy accordingly. This is the\nplace for product managers to talk about the results of preliminary experimenta-\ntion, research, or first releases, as they relate to overall goals.

Decision making usually happens after the meeting, when some-\nthing that needs action pops up.\nRoadmaps and Sales Teams\nIt\u2019s impossible to talk about communication without mentioning roadmaps.\nWhenever I say \u201croadmap,\u201d product managers inherently cringe. Companies\nstruggle with roadmaps because they\u2019ve created Gantt charts in the past, and\nthese charts basically say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to deliver this feature by January 18, and\nwe\u2019re going to deliver this feature by March 20.\u201d A lot of roadmaps have been\npromised out to customers, and they\u2019re locked into place and can\u2019t be altered.\nThis gets you into trouble when you realize you have overpromised and underde-\nlivered.\nInstead of thinking of roadmaps as a Gantt chart, you should view them as\nan explanation of strategy and the current stage of your product. This combines\nthe strategic goals with the themes of work and the emerging product delivera-\nbles from it. To do this, the product roadmap should be updated constantly, espe-\ncially at the team levels. This is why, at Produx Labs, we call them Living\nRoadmaps.\nRoadmaps are not one-size-fits-all. You need to communicate them differ-\nently, depending on whether you are talking internally to your team about uncer-\ntainty or to the sales team about features that it can communicate to customers.\nYou should design your communication to match your audience.\nOne great resource for determining how to set a roadmap is C. Todd Lom-\nbardo and Bruce McCarthy\u2019s book, Product Roadmaps Relaunched. It\u2019s an in-\ndepth, practical guide on how to create great roadmaps for your company.\nUsually, our roadmaps consist of a few key parts:\n\u2022 The theme\n\u2022 Hypothesis\n\u2022 Goals and success metrics\n\u2022 Stage of development\n\u2022 Any important milestones\n150 | ESCAPING THE BUILD TRAP\n\nI recommend aligning your company around certain terminology to deter-\nmine stages of development so everyone understands which activities are hap-\npening.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d7e92c7-bd25-4243-8833-e948ac15e975": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d7e92c7-bd25-4243-8833-e948ac15e975", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Roadmaps and Sales Teams", "start_page_idx": 167, "end_page_idx": 169}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We use these four phases:\nExperiment\nThis phase is to understand the problem and to determine whether it\u2019s\nworth solving.

You can make an agreement with the sales\nteam that anything being released as GA\u2014or anything further along in Beta\u2014\ncan be added to its sales roadmap.\nGreat communication, in the form of working agreements, meeting caden-\nces, and roadmaps, can solve many of the alignment problems in the company. It\ncan especially help move a company from being sales-led to product-led. But it\ntakes a lot of work to put all of this together. This is why you need a product oper-\nations team.\nProduct Operations\nWhen companies consist of just a handful of product teams, it is fairly easy to\nkeep track of what\u2019s going on. Leaders can walk over to the product managers to\nlearn about progress on goals. Processes are usually determined at the team level.\nCoordination is not a large concern.\nBut, as product teams scale to more than a few teams, keeping track of pro-\ngress, goals, and processes becomes a challenge. This was the frustration Chris\nwas explaining about not being able to see progress. Deploying the strategy and\ngoals, understanding success of experimentation, and reporting on progress was\ntoo much work for the product leaders of Marquetly alone. They needed to focus\non growing their product, and operations work was getting to be too much of a\ndistraction.\nTo help distribute the work, we ended up implementing a product opera-\ntions team, run by a chief of staff who reported to the CPO. The chief of staff cre-\nated a very small team (two people) to help her streamline operations and\nreporting. They oversaw the cadences of strategy, found an analytics partner to\nset up tracking, and collected and organized the progress toward goals into\nreports for executives. This allowed the product people to focus on what they\nwere good at, while product operations helped them to make informed decisions,\nby surfacing up those reports.\nIn larger organizations, you need the same thing, but at scale.

There may not be enough safety in the organization to fail and learn.\nMarquetly was successful because the CEO and leaders held back while the\nteams were experimenting, even if that made them squirm a bit.

With the\nrise of Lean Startup, we began to focus on outcomes, yes, but we also started to\ncelebrate failure. I want to be clear here: it is not a success if you fail and do not\nlearn. Learning should be at the core of every product-led organization.

The\nmanagement of the organization asks all the VPs what they plan to deliver.

They then allocate more and more\nfunds to grow the opportunities as they become validated.\nSo, for example, if a team is trying to build out a new product line as a way of\ngenerating a new revenue stream for the business, it might ask for $50,000 to\nget started and explore this new area to see whether they\u2019re on to something.\nAfter they\u2019ve proven that there is a market and have shown the data that it will\nsucceed, the team could ask for $250,000 to do more exploration or to begin\nproduct development.

Marquetly was able to achieve its strategic intents, growing its revenue\nin the enterprise and individual markets, which resulted in it being acquired for a\nvery large sum of money by a larger educational company.\nThe company continued to prioritize its strategy on a rolling basis until it\nreached its goals. The artificial time bounds of yearly budgeting and strategy cre-\nation disappeared. Instead, the company took an investment-minded approach,\nbudgeting each year for growth strategies, while funding initiatives that the prod-\nuct teams validated through experimentation and research. Marquetly ended up\nkilling a lot of its ideas early on. That allowed it to focus on what really mattered\nto achieve its goal.\nMarquetly was successful because it had a leader who understood that\nchange started with him. Chris knew that, if he did not adopt the outcome-\noriented mindset, the customer centricity, and the comfort with uncertainty, no\none else in his organization would. \u201cHow can I possibly expect the rest of my\norganization to change, if I am not willing to?\u201d he told me early on.\nEven though it was difficult for him to adapt at first, he persevered because\nhe believed in what being product led would achieve. One of the biggest mistakes\nthat companies make in these transitions is having leadership think that it\u2019s\neveryone else\u2019s job to change instead of theirs. I explained to Chris how I had\nseen some major transformations fail because they were delegated. He listened.\n167\n| 25\n\nHe surrounded himself with smart product leaders, like CPO Jen, and then\ntrusted his team to achieve the outcomes.

Bringing her\nexperimental mindset to a much larger company was not easy, but with the\nseniority came more opportunity and authority to change how people perceived\nbuilding products.\nThe Marquetly team was able to escape the build trap by implementing a\ncustomer-centric product management division, supporting them with the right\nstrategy and then enabling their processes of experimentation with safety and\npolicies that promoted learning. By focusing on the outcomes instead of on the\noutputs, it was able to actually achieve them.\nGetting out of the build trap is possible, but it takes time and effort. It\u2019s not\nsomething that you can easily achieve in a year. It requires not only changing\nhow you work but also how you think as an organization. It needs the participa-\ntion of everyone in the organization, from the leaders in the C-Suite to the prod-\nuct managers on the teams. Reading this book is your first step.

See, there wasn\u2019t just one thing I had learned\u2014but\nmany things I needed to learn at different stages of my career.\nWhen I was first starting off as a product manager, I needed to learn about\nhumility. I learned that my role was not that of the big idea generator but that of\nthe bad idea terminator. I needed to learn to be humble and to gain the support\nand buy-in of my team in order to make great products. Experimenting with my\nteam taught me the power of data. Data beats any opinion every time.\nAs I moved on to more senior roles, I learned that having a good strategic\nframework could make or break a company. That if you did not judge people for\nsuccess by outcomes, you would never achieve those outcomes. I watched a few\ncompanies crumble under the weight of a bad strategic framework.\nBecoming a consultant taught me about the power of personalities in an\norganization. People will get in the way of a good product every time. Even if it is\nthe best idea for the company, if it doesn\u2019t meet the personal agendas of senior\nstakeholders, it can be squashed. To mitigate that risk, you need to deeply under-\nstand what motivates people and to know how you can address their personal\nmotivations by introducing information and data that wins them over.\nConsulting also taught me that one of the quickest ways to kill the spirit of a\ngreat employee is to put them in an environment where they can\u2019t succeed.\nThat\u2019s when most people leave. Even good product managers become tired of\nwaking up and going to war every day. They spend too much time trying to\n169\n\nchange the policies so that they can succeed at their job rather than building the\nbest product they can.\nThe truth is that most organizations out there are not product-led. And yet,\nbeing product-led is a winning strategy.

Instead, they are developing products with the intent to deliver value to their\ncustomers.\nBeing agile, being customer-centric\u2014these things are already baked into\ntheir culture. They understand that the fundamental criterion for building a\nproduct is that the product solves a problem for a user. They do not just build\nthings for the sake of checking boxes. They build things to further their business.\nTen years ago, when I started my journey in product management, I looked\naround and could barely find any peers. Now, smart and talented product manag-\ners abound, looking for the right organizations. They want to join product-led\norganizations, and they want to build kick-ass products that their customers love.\nIt is my hope that more organizations will escape the build trap, empower these\nproduct managers to thrive, and create products that we all enjoy.\nSo, if you want to determine whether yours is a product-led company\u2014or\nhow far you might be from one\u2014I leave you with these final six questions, which\nare the ones I ask whenever I am brought in to evaluate whether a company has\nescaped the build trap.

Well, our\nteam did. Right? That\u2019s how it normally works.\u201d This kind of response is a\nsign of a healthy product management organization, in which manage-\nment sets the goals and the team is given room to figure out how to reach\nthem. The product manager should be leading the charge to discover user\nproblems and to solve them. This doesn\u2019t mean that an important initiative\nor solution idea can\u2019t come from management every once in a while, but\nthat should be the exception, not the rule.\nIt\u2019s a huge red flag when a team not only can\u2019t take ownership for what\nit is building, but can\u2019t even tell me why it is building it. This means that\nthe originator of the idea never connected the why to the what.\nWhat was the last product you decided to kill?\nAnother sign of an unhealthy product management culture is the inability\nto kill a product or idea that will not help a company reach its goals. If you\nhear, \u201cWe never really kill anything,\u201d it often means that there\u2019s a pretty big\nproblem.\nTypically, this happens for one of the following reasons:\n171\n| A\n\n1 \u201cInterviewing for the Job is Product Management,\u201d http://bit.ly/2JgKR9X.\n\u2022 The organization already committed the idea to customers.

It doesn\u2019t matter whether the client actually reques-\nted it or whether it achieves any of the organization\u2019s desired goals.\n\u2022 Budgeting can\u2019t budge.

They\u2019re worried about us annoying them too much.\u201d\nWithout a healthy dialogue between a company and its customers,\nthere is no way to truly learn about what the customers want or need. An\norganization set up for success not only allows product managers to talk to\ncustomers, it encourages them to do so and recognizes this process as a\nhuge part of the job. In fact, your interviewee should be probing you for\nclues that you are comfortable talking to customers and that you aren\u2019t\nplanning to spend all your time safely indoors writing user stories.\nWhat is your goal?\nThis is the first question I ask any product manager during an interview\nprocess.1 If the product manager cannot articulate a clear goal, it\u2019s a sign of\npoor product management at the organizational level. If the product man-\nager does have a goal but it is more output centric than outcome focused,\nthis also signifies an unhealthy product team.

I\u2019ve seen many organizations where the prod-\nuct management function was not well-respected. There were two causes:\nproduct managers were either seen as too strong, or they were seen as too\nweak.\nIn the first instance, product managers were seen as dictators who\nthrew out requirements to the team rather than involving them in their\ndecision-making process. The teams grew resentful and felt they were\ntreated as resources rather than as colleagues. A good product manager\nknows that getting buy-in from the whole team is crucial. The product\nmanager is not the only person who should be coming up with the ideas\nbut should instead be harnessing their team\u2019s full capacity. A sign of a\nhealthy product team is hearing development and UX people say, \u201cI love\nmy product manager. She has clear direction, communicates well, and\nhelps keep us stay focused on the goals and problems.\u201d\nIn the second instance, product managers are seen as weak in the\norganization because they are beaten down by stakeholders2 and manage-\nment.
